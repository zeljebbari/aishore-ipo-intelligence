Our fiscal year end is June 30, and our fiscal quarters end on September 30, December 31, March 31, and June 30. Our fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019 are referred to herein as fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, respectively. Overview Our Purpose We believe physical activity is fundamental to a healthy and happy life. Our ambition is to empower people to improve their lives through fitness. We are a technology company that meshes the physical and digital worlds to create a completely new, immersive, and connected fitness experience. We are also: \u2026a media company that creates engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive original programming with the best instructors in the world. \u2026an interactive software company that motivates our Members to achieve their goals. \u2026a product design company that develops beautiful and intuitive equipment that anticipates the needs of our Members. \u2026a social connection company that enables our community to support one another. \u2026a direct-to-consumer, multi-channel retail company that facilitates a seamless customer journey. \u2026an apparel company that allows Members to display their passion for Peloton. \u2026a logistics company that provides high-touch delivery, set up, and service for our Members. We are driven by our Members-first obsession and we will be any company we need to be in order to deliver the best fitness experience possible. Who We Are Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient, while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the best versions of themselves. We define a Member as any individual who has a Peloton account. We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that our Members love. Our highly compelling offering helped our Members complete over 58 million Peloton workouts in fiscal 2019. Driven by our Members-first mindset, we built a vertically integrated platform that ensures a best-in-class, end-to-end experience. We have a direct-to-consumer multi-channel sales platform, including 74 showrooms with knowledgeable sales specialists, a high-touch delivery service, and helpful Member support teams. Our Members are as devoted to us as we are to them\u201492% of our interactive fitness equipment ever sold, which we refer to as our Connected Fitness Products, still had an active Connected Fitness Subscription attached as of June 30, 2019. 1 Table of Contents Our Connected Fitness Product offerings currently include the Peloton Bike, launched in 2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Both our Bike and Tread include a state-of-the-art touchscreen that streams live and on-demand classes. Our products have a multitude of interactive software features that encourage frequent use, facilitate healthy competition on our patented leaderboard, build community among our Members, and inspire our Members to track performance and achieve their goals with real-time and historical metrics. As of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products, with approximately 564,000 sold in the United States. Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength training, stretching, and meditation. We produce over 950 original programs per month and maintain a vast and constantly updated library of thousands of original fitness and wellness programs. We make it easy for Members to find a class that fits their interests based on class type, instructor, music genre, length, available equipment, area of physical focus, and level of difficulty. Our content is available on our Connected Fitness Products through a $39.00 monthly Connected Fitness Subscription, which allows for unlimited workouts across multiple users within a household. Our Connected Fitness Subscribers can enjoy our classes anywhere through our digital app, Peloton Digital, which is available through iOS and Android mobile devices, as well as most tablets and computers. We also have Digital Subscribers who pay $19.49 per month for access to our content library on their own devices. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have experienced significant growth in sales of Connected Fitness Products, which, when combined with our strong Connected Fitness Subscriber retention rates, has driven high growth in Connected Fitness Subscribers. Our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew by 108% in fiscal 2019. Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, generates attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. When we acquire new Connected Fitness Subscribers, we are able to offset our customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our Connected Fitness Products. This allows for rapid payback of our sales and marketing investments and results in a robust unit economic model. We are a fast-growing and scaled fitness platform. For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019: [TABLE_7] \u2022 we generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3% year-over-year growth; [TABLE_8] \u2022 we incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and $(195.6) million, respectively; and [TABLE_9] \u2022 our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3) million, respectively. See the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, key metrics of our business included: [TABLE_10] \u2022 Connected Fitness Subscribers of 107,708, 245,667, and 511,202, respectively; and [TABLE_11] \u2022 Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.70%, 0.64%, and 0.65%, respectively. For a definition of Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Business Model\u201d and for a definition of Connected Fitness Subscribers, Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, and Subscription Contribution Margin, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Key Operational and Business Metrics.\u201d 2 Table of Contents Our Industry and Opportunity Industry We participate in the massive and growing global health and wellness industry. According to a 2018 report by the Global Wellness Institute, the total global spend on the wellness industry in 2017 was $4.2 trillion, of which the global fitness and certain categories of wellness, including meditation and yoga, spend represented nearly $600 billion. According to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, or IHRSA, 183 million and 62 million people had gym memberships globally and in the United States, respectively, as of 2018. Our current product portfolio, which consists of our Bike, Tread, and fitness and wellness subscription services, addresses a large consumer base. Within our current and announced markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany), we estimate that 75 million people used treadmills and 27 million used stationary cycling bikes in the 12 months ended March 2019. In those same regions, we estimate that over 5 million treadmills and nearly 3 million stationary cycling bikes were purchased for in-home use in the 12 months ended March 2019. We believe that we are significantly expanding the market for fitness equipment and products. According to our 2019 Member Survey, four out of five Members were not in the market for home fitness equipment prior to purchasing a Peloton Connected Fitness Product. Opportunity We consider our market opportunity in terms of a Total Addressable Market, or TAM, which we believe is the market we can reach over the long-term in our current and announced markets, and a Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, which we address with our current product verticals and price points. According to our research, our TAM is 67 million households, of which 45 million are in the United States. Within our TAM, we estimate that 52 million households are interested in learning more about our Connected Fitness Products without seeing the price. We estimate that our SAM is 14 million Connected Fitness Products, with 12 million represented in the United States. Historically, our SAM has grown as our brand awareness has increased. With low brand awareness in our current international markets, we believe we will see SAM expand as we make further investments in building brand and product awareness in these regions. We will grow both TAM and SAM as we expand beyond our current geographies and grow SAM as we develop new Connected Fitness Products and content in new fitness verticals. With approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products sold globally as of June 30, 2019, we are approximately 4% penetrated in our SAM of 14 million. For a discussion of the methodology used in determining our TAM and SAM, see the section titled \u201cIndustry and Market Data.\u201d 3 Table of Contents [TABLE_12] * Represents our total addressable market within our current and announced markets\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. Consumer Trends in Our Favor Increasing Focus on Health and Wellness The growing awareness of the benefits of exercise and physical activity is driving increasing participation and spend in fitness and wellness. This has translated into consistent year-over-year growth of the fitness industry both in the United States and globally over the past two decades, even during times of economic recession. According to IHRSA, health club industry revenues in the United States grew at a 5.4% annual growth rate over the last ten years. In addition, employers and health insurance companies are investing in employee well-being by offering incentives for preventative health measures such as exercise. According to a 2017 study by the National Business Group on Health, 74% of employers offer employee wellness incentives, with the average employee incentive amount increasing from $521 in 2013 to $742 in 2017. Streaming Media is the Leading Channel of Consumption The quality, volume, and speed of streaming content has profoundly changed media consumption patterns. Consumers can select from extensive catalogs of content across video programming, music, books, and gaming, among other categories, allowing for personalized, on-demand consumption anywhere, anytime, and at a great value. According to Kagan, a media research group of S&P Global Market Intelligence, global digital music paid subscribers are estimated to have grown from 12.1 million in 2012 to 162.5 million in 2018. Similarly, digital video paid subscribers are estimated to have increased in the United States from 37.6 million in 2012 to 167.8 million in 2018. Desire for Community and Shared Experiences We believe consumers are increasingly spending on experiences and are seeking meaningful community connections. Within the fitness industry, consumers have migrated to boutique fitness due to personalization, expert instruction, and the sense of community. Boutique-style fitness offerings are the fastest growing brick-and-mortar fitness category. According to IHRSA, as of 2017, 40% of members of health and fitness clubs reported belonging to a boutique fitness studio, and from 2013 to 2017, membership in boutique studios grew approximately 121%. Demand for Convenience Household trends, longer working hours, and the rise of mobile technology make it challenging to balance time between family, work, and personal health and wellness. According to the Pew Research Center, over the last few decades, there has been an increase in dual income families from 49% in 1970 to 66% in 2016. We believe that busy lifestyles, less free time, and changing household dynamics are driving demand for convenient fitness options. What Sets Us Apart Category-Defining Brand with Broad Appeal Peloton is the pioneer of connected, technology-enabled fitness. By meshing the physical and digital worlds, we have created an immersive experience that our Members love. We have scaled rapidly through data-driven marketing and education-based 4 Table of Contents sales efforts. Our marketing is made more efficient by the significant word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, which has become one of our largest sales channels. As a result of strong Connected Fitness Product sales and low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, we have grown our Connected Fitness Subscribers from 35,135 as of June 30, 2016 to 511,202 as of June 30, 2019, representing annualized growth of approximately 144.1%. We are democratizing access to high-quality boutique fitness by making it accessible and affordable through the compelling value of our unlimited household Connected Fitness Subscriptions and attractive financing programs for the Bike and Tread. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal\u2014our fastest growing demographic segments are consumers under 35 years old and those with household incomes under $75,000. Growing and Scaled Platform with Network Effects As the largest interactive fitness platform in the world, our rapidly growing and scaled Member base is a highly strategic asset. With our first mover advantage, we have achieved critical mass, which improves our platform and Member experience. As of June 30, 2019, on average, nearly 6,400 Members participated in each cycling class, across live and on-demand. As our community of Members continues to grow, the Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more competitive, more immersive, and more connected. Over time, Members are embedded in the Peloton community and we become a part of their lives, increasing the opportunity cost of Members leaving or potential Members not joining our platform. Engaging-to-the-Point-of-Addictive Fitness Experience Drives High Retention By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their personal goals. We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us develop features that improve our Member experience and create new, on-trend fitness and wellness content that our Members crave. Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen workouts increase over time. On average, our Connected Fitness Subscribers completed 7.5, 8.4, and 11.5 workouts per month in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our exceptional weighted-average 12-month Connected Fitness Subscriber retention rate of 95% across all fiscal year cohorts since fiscal 2016. Vertically Integrated Platform That is Difficult to Replicate We are driven by our Members-first obsession and see every Member touchpoint as an opportunity to exceed expectations. To create the best platform, we designed our own products, developed our own interactive software, and created our own high production value fitness and wellness programming. For full end-to-end Member support, we were also compelled to develop our own customer education, purchase and delivery, and services platform. We sell our Connected Fitness Products exclusively through our knowledgeable inside sales and showroom associates as well as our e-commerce site. Our high-touch delivery teams ensure that new Members are immediately set up and ready to work out on their new Bike or Tread. The effectiveness of our end-to-end platform is demonstrated by the high Net Promoter Score for our Bike, which has been within the range of 80 to 93 since we began measuring it in 2016. Compelling Financial Model Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer acquisition. Our growth is attributable to our data-driven marketing approach and Member word-of-mouth referrals, both of which help us generate predictable and increasingly efficient Connected Fitness Product sales. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, combined with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, results in attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. We offset customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our Connected Fitness Products, generating rapid payback of sales and marketing investments and robust unit economics. Founder-Led, Passionate Team Peloton was founded by John Foley in 2012. Along with his four co-founders, John set out to create the most convenient and immersive indoor cycling experience in the world. Our founders believed deeply that creating a Members-first experience would require Peloton to be as vertically integrated as possible, and so we built teams that span software development, product design, fitness instruction, content production, marketing, music, logistics, retail, and apparel. We believe that no other company is at the intersection of all these disciplines, which means that every day we are doing something that no other company has done before. This, along with the positive impact we have on our Members\u2019 physical and mental well-being, fuels our passion for continuous innovation and progress. 5 Table of Contents Growth Strategies Our goal is to rapidly grow our Member base through the sale of our Connected Fitness Products while continuing to engage and retain our scaled and loyal community of Members. Grow Brand Awareness We are still in the early stages of growth in our existing markets. As of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products globally, a small fraction of the 14 million products we believe reflect our SAM. While our aided brand awareness has grown rapidly in the United States and reached 67% as of April 3, 2019, we have significant room to increase our brand and product awareness in both the United States and in our other geographies through television, digital, and social media marketing, as well as our showrooms and word-of-mouth referrals. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal by educating customers on the compelling value of our Connected Fitness Subscriptions. Continuously Improve Member Experience We constantly improve and evolve our interactive software and content to drive Member engagement, which helps us maintain our high retention rates as we grow. We deploy new software features frequently and currently produce over 950 original programs per month to keep our content library fresh and on-trend. We also continue to drive usage through innovative fitness and wellness programs and goal-based challenges that make Members feel more accountable and help them reach their personal goals. Total Workouts for our Connected Fitness Subscribers grew from 17.9 million in fiscal 2018 to 52.2 million in fiscal 2019, representing a 192% increase. For a definition of Total Workouts, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Key Operational and Business Metrics.\u201d Launch New Products and Expand Content Offering Over time, we plan to invest heavily in new product development and content to further penetrate our SAM. We will launch new Connected Fitness Products and accessories in our existing, as well as new fitness verticals, while continuously updating and expanding our original fitness and wellness programming. We will pursue new products where there is a large market opportunity in areas of fitness with staying power. Pursue Disciplined Expansion into New Geographies With more than 174 million people belonging to gyms globally, we believe there is significant opportunity for Peloton to grow internationally. In 2018, we began our international expansion and brought the Peloton experience to the United Kingdom and Canada. With our expansion into Germany in the winter of 2019, we will be in the largest fitness markets in the world. We will continue to pursue disciplined international expansion by targeting countries with high fitness penetration and spend, the presence of boutique fitness, and where we believe the Peloton value proposition will resonate. Invest in Our Platform We will continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to extend our leadership in connected fitness, increase our value proposition, and support our growth. Over the next couple of years, we will continue to invest in state-of-the-art production studios in New York City and London and a new headquarters in New York City, which will include a dedicated research and development facility for new product design, development, and testing. We will continue to invest heavily in a variety of software and hardware engineering functions, supply chain operations, manufacturing, and advanced quality assurance to support our growth. Increase Profitability Through Fixed Cost Leverage The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating leverage. A significant portion of our content creation costs can be leveraged over time given that a limited number of production studios and instructors can support the future growth of our Subscriber base, which includes both our Connected Fitness and Digital Subscribers. We expect to drive continued efficiencies in sales and marketing expenses as we benefit from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth referrals from our growing Subscriber base, and further optimization of our sales and marketing investments by channel. We will also achieve operating leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative expenses, including those associated with our new headquarters in New York City. 6 Table of Contents Risks Associated with Our Business Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d immediately following this Prospectus Summary. Some of these risks include: [TABLE_13] \u2022 We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future; [TABLE_14] \u2022 We may be unable to attract and retain Subscribers, which could have an adverse effect on our business and rate of growth; [TABLE_15] \u2022 If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products and services in a timely manner or effectively manage the introduction of new or enhanced products and services, our business may be adversely affected; [TABLE_16] \u2022 The market for our products and services is still in the early stages of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected; [TABLE_17] \u2022 We have a limited operating history, our past financial results may not be indicative of our future performance, and our revenue growth rate is likely to slow as our business matures; [TABLE_18] \u2022 We operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors; [TABLE_19] \u2022 We derive a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our Bike and a decline in sales of our Bike would negatively affect our future revenue and operating results; [TABLE_20] \u2022 We rely on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners for our Connected Fitness Products and a loss of any of these partners could negatively affect our business; [TABLE_21] \u2022 We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks, including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products & services on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity; [TABLE_22] \u2022 We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our content and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition; [TABLE_23] \u2022 Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of the Peloton brand; and [TABLE_24] \u2022 The dual class structure of our common stock will have the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, including our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include: [TABLE_25] \u2022 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; [TABLE_26] \u2022 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and [TABLE_27] \u2022 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (2) the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering. We may take advantage of these exemptions until such time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. 8 Table of Contents THE OFFERING [TABLE_28] Class A common stock offered by us shares [TABLE_29] Option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock offered by us shares [TABLE_30] Class A common stock to be outstanding after this offering shares ( shares if the option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full) [TABLE_31] Class B common stock to be outstanding after this offering shares [TABLE_32] Total Class A and Class B common stock to be outstanding after this offering shares [TABLE_33] Use of Proceeds We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately $ million, or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses.

[TABLE_61] (2) The pro forma as adjusted column reflects the items described in footnote (1) the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. The pro forma as adjusted information discussed above is illustrative only and will be adjusted based on the actual public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) cash and cash equivalents, working capital, total assets, and total stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase (decrease) cash and cash equivalents, working capital, total assets, and total stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity by approximately $ million, assuming the assumed initial public offering price, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. 14 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of our Class A common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Risks Related to Our Business We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We have incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2012, including net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and $(195.6) million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. As a result, we had a total stockholders\u2019 deficit of $(538.6) million at June 30, 2019. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, expand our operating and retail infrastructure, add content and software features to our platform, expand into new geographies, and develop new Connected Fitness Products. Further, as a public company, we will incur additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These efforts and additional expenses may be more costly than we expect, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our revenue to offset our operating expenses. Our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including reduced demand for our products and services, increased competition, a decrease in the growth or reduction in size of our overall market, or if we cannot capitalize on growth opportunities. If our revenue does not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. We may be unable to attract and retain Subscribers, which could have an adverse effect on our business and rate of growth. We have experienced significant Subscriber growth over the past several years. Our continued business and revenue growth is dependent on our ability to continuously attract and retain Subscribers, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in these efforts, or that Subscriber retention levels will not materially decline. There are a number of factors that could lead to a decline in Subscriber levels or that could prevent us from increasing our Subscriber levels, including: [TABLE_62] \u2022 our failure to introduce new features, products, or services that Members find engaging or our introduction of new products or services, or changes to existing products and services that are not favorably received; [TABLE_63] \u2022 harm to our brand and reputation; [TABLE_64] \u2022 pricing and perceived value of our offerings; [TABLE_65] \u2022 our inability to deliver quality products, content, and services; [TABLE_66] \u2022 our Members engaging with competitive products and services; [TABLE_67] \u2022 technical or other problems preventing Members from accessing our content and services in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affecting the Member experience; [TABLE_68] \u2022 unsatisfactory experiences with the delivery, installation, or service of our Connected Fitness Products; [TABLE_69] \u2022 a decline in the public\u2019s interest in indoor cycling or running, or other fitness disciplines that we invest most heavily in; and [TABLE_70] \u2022 deteriorating general economic conditions or a change in consumer spending preferences or buying trends. Additionally, further expansion into international markets such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany will create new challenges in attracting and retaining Subscribers that we may not successfully address. As a result of these factors, we cannot be sure that our Subscriber levels will be adequate to maintain or permit the expansion of our operations. A decline in Subscriber levels could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 15 Table of Contents If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products and services in a timely manner or effectively manage the introduction of new or enhanced products and services, our business may be adversely affected. Our success in maintaining and increasing our Subscriber base depends on our ability to identify and originate trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products and services are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to introduce new or enhanced offerings in a timely manner, or our new or enhanced offerings are not accepted by our Subscribers, our competitors may introduce similar offerings faster than us, which could negatively affect our rate of growth. Moreover, our new offerings may not receive consumer acceptance as preferences could shift rapidly to different types of fitness and wellness offerings or away from these types of offerings altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower subscription rates, lower sales, pricing pressure, lower gross margins, discounting of our existing Connected Fitness Products, and excess inventory levels. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address them will partially depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality offerings. Development of new or enhanced products and services may require significant time and financial investment, which could result in increased costs and a reduction in our profit margins. For example, we have historically incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product and service introduction. Moreover, we must successfully manage introductions of new or enhanced products and services, which could adversely impact the sales of our existing products and services. For instance, consumers may decide to purchase new or enhanced products and services instead of our existing products and services, which could lead to excess product inventory and discounting of our existing products and services. The market for our products and services is still in the early stages of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected. The connected fitness and wellness market is relatively new, rapidly growing, largely unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will sustain high levels of demand and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success depends substantially on the willingness of consumers to widely adopt our products and services. To be successful, we will have to educate consumers about our products and services through significant investment, and provide quality content that is superior to the content and experiences provided by our competitors. Additionally, the fitness and wellness market at large is heavily saturated, and the demand for and market acceptance of new products and services in the market is uncertain. It is difficult to predict the future growth rates, if any, and size of our market. We cannot assure you that our market will develop, that the public\u2019s interest in connected fitness and wellness will continue, or that our products and services will be widely adopted. If our market does not develop, develops more slowly than expected, or becomes saturated with competitors, or if our products and services do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected. We have a limited operating history and our past financial results may not be indicative of our future performance. Further, our revenue growth rate is likely to slow as our business matures. We began operations in 2012, shipped our first Bike in 2014, and shipped our first Tread in 2018. We have a limited history of generating revenue. As a result of our short operating history, we have limited financial data that can be used to evaluate our current business. Therefore, our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. In particular, we have experienced periods of high revenue growth since we began selling our Bike that we do not expect to continue as our business matures. Estimates of future revenue growth are subject to many risks and uncertainties and our future revenue may differ materially from our projections. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including market acceptance of our products and services, attracting and retaining Subscribers, and increasing competition and expenses as we expand our business. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these and other challenges we may face in the future, and our business may be adversely affected if we do not manage these risks 16 Table of Contents successfully. In addition, we may not achieve sufficient revenue to attain or maintain positive cash flows from operations or profitability in any given period, or at all. We operate in a highly competitive market and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors. Our products and services are offered in a highly competitive market. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including at-home fitness equipment and content, fitness clubs, in-studio fitness classes, and health and wellness apps. Moreover, we expect the competition in our market to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and services that compete with ours. Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, products, features, content, services, or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more successful product development efforts, create more compelling employment opportunities, or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our competitors may develop or acquire, or have already developed or acquired, intellectual property rights that significantly limit or prevent our ability to compete effectively in the public marketplace. In addition, our competitors may have significantly greater resources than us, allowing them to identify and capitalize more efficiently upon opportunities in new markets and consumer preferences and trends, quickly transition and adapt their products and services, devote greater resources to marketing and advertising, or be better positioned to withstand substantial price competition. If we are not able to compete effectively against our competitors, they may acquire and engage customers or generate revenue at the expense of our efforts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We derive a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our Bike. A decline in sales of our Bike would negatively affect our future revenue and operating results. Our Connected Fitness Products are sold in highly competitive markets with limited barriers to entry. Introduction by competitors of comparable products at lower price points, a maturing product lifecycle, a decline in consumer spending, or other factors could result in a decline in our revenue derived from our Connected Fitness Products, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Because we derive a significant majority of our revenue from the sales of our Bike, any material decline in sales of our Bike would have a pronounced impact on our future revenue and operating results. We rely on a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners for our Connected Fitness Products. A loss of any of these partners could negatively affect our business. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture and transport our Connected Fitness Products, including in some cases only a single supplier for some of our products and components. Our reliance on a limited number of manufacturers for each of our Connected Fitness Products increases our risks, since we do not currently have alternative or replacement manufacturers beyond these key parties. In the event of interruption from any of our manufacturers, we may not be able to increase capacity from other sources or develop alternate or secondary sources without incurring material additional costs and substantial delays. Furthermore, all of these manufacturers\u2019 primary facilities are located in Taiwan. Thus, our business could be adversely affected if one or more of our suppliers is impacted by a natural disaster or other interruption at a particular location. If we experience a significant increase in demand for our Connected Fitness Products, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or partner, we may be unable to supplement or replace them on terms that are acceptable to us, which may undermine our ability to deliver our products to Members in a timely manner. For example, it may take a significant amount of time to identify a manufacturer that has the capability and resources to build our products to our specifications in sufficient volume. Identifying suitable suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners is an extensive process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, technical capabilities, responsiveness and service, financial stability, regulatory compliance, and labor and other ethical practices. Accordingly, a loss of any of our significant suppliers, manufactures, or logistics partners could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 17 Table of Contents We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks, including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products and services on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. We have limited control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners, which subjects us to risks, such as the following: [TABLE_71] \u2022 inability to satisfy demand for our Connected Fitness Products; [TABLE_72] \u2022 reduced control over delivery timing and product reliability; [TABLE_73] \u2022 reduced ability to monitor the manufacturing process and components used in our Connected Fitness Products; [TABLE_74] \u2022 limited ability to develop comprehensive manufacturing specifications that take into account any materials shortages or substitutions; [TABLE_75] \u2022 variance in the manufacturing capability of our third-party manufacturers; [TABLE_76] \u2022 price increases; [TABLE_77] \u2022 failure of a significant supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner to perform its obligations to us for technical, market, or other reasons; [TABLE_78] \u2022 variance in the quality of last mile services provided by our third-party logistics partners; [TABLE_79] \u2022 difficulties in establishing additional supplier, manufacturer, or logistics partner relationships if we experience difficulties with our existing suppliers, manufacturers, or logistics partners; [TABLE_80] \u2022 shortages of materials or components; [TABLE_81] \u2022 misappropriation of our intellectual property; [TABLE_82] \u2022 exposure to natural catastrophes, political unrest, terrorism, labor disputes, and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our Connected Fitness Products are manufactured or the components thereof are sourced; [TABLE_83] \u2022 changes in local economic conditions in the jurisdictions where our suppliers, manufacturers, and logistics partners are located; [TABLE_84] \u2022 the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on currency exchange or the transfer of funds; and [TABLE_85] \u2022 insufficient warranties and indemnities on components supplied to our manufacturers or performance by our partners. We also rely on our logistics partners, including last mile warehouse and delivery partners, to complete a substantial percentage of our deliveries to customers, with the rest of the deliveries handled by our own last mile team. Our primary last mile partner relies on a network of independent contractors to perform last mile services for us in many markets. If any of these independent contractors, or the last mile partner as a whole, do not perform their obligations or meet the expectations of us or our Members, our reputation and business could suffer. The occurrence of any of these risks, especially during seasons of peak demand, could cause us to experience a significant disruption in our ability to produce and deliver our products to our customers. We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our content. An adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Music is an important element of the overall content that we make available to our Members. To secure the rights to use music in our content, we enter into agreements to obtain licenses from rights holders such as record labels, music publishers, performing rights organizations, collecting societies, artists, and other copyright owners or their agents. We pay royalties to such parties or their agents around the world. The process of obtaining licenses involves identifying and negotiating with many rights holders, some of whom are unknown or difficult to identify, and implicates a myriad of complex and evolving legal issues across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as to when and whether particular licenses are needed. Rights holders also may attempt to 18 Table of Contents take advantage of their market power to seek onerous financial terms from us. Our relationship with certain rights holders may deteriorate. Artists and/or artist groups may object and may exert public or private pressure on rights holders to discontinue or to modify license terms. Additionally, there is a risk that aspiring rights holders, their agents, or legislative or regulatory bodies will create or attempt to create new rights that could require us to enter into new license agreements with, and pay royalties to, newly defined groups of rights holders, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify. With respect to musical compositions, in addition to obtaining publishing rights, we generally need to obtain separate public performance rights. In the United States, public performance rights are typically obtained through intermediaries known as performing rights organizations, or PROs, which (a) issue blanket licenses with copyright users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory, (b) collect royalties under those licenses, and (c) distribute such royalties to copyright owners. We have agreements with each of the following PROs in the United States: the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP, and Broadcast Music, Inc., or BMI, Global Music Rights, and SESAC. The royalty rates available to us from the PROs today may not be available to us in the future. Licenses provided by ASCAP and BMI currently are governed by consent decrees, which were issued by the U.S. Department of Justice in an effort to curb anti-competitive conduct. Removal of or changes to the terms or interpretation of these agreements could affect our ability to obtain licenses from these PROs on current and/or otherwise favorable terms, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. In other parts of the world, including in Canada and Europe, we obtain licenses for musical compositions either through local collecting societies representing publishers, or from publishers directly, or a combination thereof. We cannot guarantee that our licenses with collecting societies and our direct licenses with publishers provide full coverage for all of the musical compositions we use in our service in the countries in which we operate, or that we may enter in the future. Publishers, songwriters, and other rights holders who choose not to be represented by major or independent publishing companies or collecting societies have, and could in the future, adversely impact our ability to secure licensing arrangements in connection with musical compositions that such rights holders own or control, and could increase the risk of liability for copyright infringement. Although we expend significant resources to seek to comply with the statutory, regulatory, and judicial frameworks, we cannot guarantee that we currently hold, or will always hold, every necessary right to use all of the music that is used on our service, and we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights, or that we will not do so in the future. These challenges, and others concerning the licensing of music on our platform, may subject us to significant liability for copyright infringement, breach of contract, or other claims. For additional information, see the section titled \u201cBusiness\u2014Legal Proceedings.\u201d Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of the Peloton brand. We believe that our brand is important to attracting and retaining Members. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts, ability to provide consistent, high-quality products, services, features, content, and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the \u201cPeloton\u201d mark, our \u201cP\u201d logo, and other trademarks important to our brand. We believe that the importance of our brand will increase as competition further intensifies and brand promotion activities may require substantial expenditures. Our brand could be harmed if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Unfavorable publicity about us, including our products, services, technology, customer service, content, personnel, and suppliers could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our products and services. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement and loyalty of our Member base and result in decreased revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have grown rapidly in recent years and have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our brand, company culture, and financial performance may suffer. We have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size. For example, between June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2019, our employee headcount increased from 443 to 1,950, and we expect headcount growth 19 Table of Contents to continue for the foreseeable future. Further, as we grow, our business becomes increasingly complex. To effectively manage and capitalize on our growth, we must continue to expand our sales and marketing, focus on innovative product and content development, upgrade our management information systems and other processes, and obtain more space for our expanding staff. Our continued growth could strain our existing resources, and we could experience ongoing operating difficulties in managing our business across numerous jurisdictions, including difficulties in hiring, training, and managing a diffuse and growing employee base. Failure to scale and preserve our company culture with growth could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. Moreover, the vertically integrated nature of our business, where we design our own Connected Fitness Products, develop our own software, produce original fitness and wellness programming, sell our products exclusively through our own sales teams and e-commerce site, and deliver and service our Connected Fitness Products, exposes us to risk and disruption at many points that are critical to successfully operating our business and may make it more difficult for us to scale our business. If we do not adapt to meet these evolving challenges, or if our management team does not effectively scale with our growth, we may experience erosion to our brand, the quality of our products and services may suffer, and our company culture may be harmed. Our growth strategy contemplates a significant increase in our advertising and other marketing spending and expanding our retail showroom presence. Many of our existing retail showrooms are relatively new and we cannot assure you that these showrooms or that future showrooms will generate revenue and cash flow comparable with those generated by our more mature locations, especially as we move to new geographic markets. Further, many of our retail showrooms are leased pursuant to multi-year short-term leases, and our ability to negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or for a lease renewal option may depend on factors that are not within our control. We may also open additional production studios as we expand internationally, which will require significant additional investment. Successful implementation of our growth strategy will require significant expenditures before any substantial associated revenue is generated and we cannot guarantee that these increased investments will result in corresponding and offsetting revenue growth. Because we have a limited history operating our business at its current scale, it is difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. Our limited operating experience at this scale, combined with the rapidly evolving nature of the market in which we sell our products and services, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may develop, and other economic factors beyond our control, reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We cannot compel third parties to license their music to us, and our business may be adversely affected if our access to music is limited. The concentration of control of content by major music licensors means that the actions of one or a few licensors may adversely affect our ability to provide our service. We enter into license agreements to obtain rights to use music in our service, including with major record companies (Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group), independent record labels, major music publishers (Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner/Chappell Music), and independent music publishers and administrators who collectively hold the rights to a significant number of sound recordings and musical compositions. Comprehensive and accurate ownership information for the musical compositions embodied in sound recordings is sometimes unavailable, or in some cases, impossible to obtain if withheld by the owners or administrators of such rights. In some cases, we obtain ownership information directly from music publishers, and in other cases we rely on the assistance of third parties to determine ownership information. If the information provided to us or obtained by such third parties does not comprehensively or accurately identify the ownership of musical compositions, or if we are unable to determine which musical compositions correspond to specific sound recordings, it becomes difficult or impossible to identify the appropriate rights holders to whom to pay royalties. This may make it difficult to comply with the obligations of any agreements with those rights holders or to secure the appropriate licenses with all necessary parties. Given the high level of content concentration in the music industry, the market power of a few licensors, and the lack of transparent ownership information for compositions, we may be unable to license a large amount of music or the music of certain popular artists, and our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially harmed. 20 Table of Contents We are a party to many music license agreements that are complex and impose numerous obligations upon us that may make it difficult to operate our business, and a breach of such agreements could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our license agreements are complex and impose numerous obligations on us, including obligations to, among other things: [TABLE_86] \u2022 calculate and make payments based on complex royalty structures, which requires tracking usage of content in our service that may have inaccurate or incomplete metadata necessary for such calculation; [TABLE_87] \u2022 provide periodic reports on the exploitation of the content in specified formats; [TABLE_88] \u2022 represent that we will obtain all necessary publishing licenses and consents and pay all associated fees, royalties, and other amounts due for the licensing of musical compositions; [TABLE_89] \u2022 comply with certain marketing and advertising restrictions; [TABLE_90] \u2022 grant the licensor the right to audit our compliance with the terms of such agreements; and [TABLE_91] \u2022 comply with certain security and technical specifications. Certain of our license agreements also contain minimum guarantees or require that we make minimum guarantee or advance payments, which are not always tied to our number of Subscribers or stream counts for music used in our service. Accordingly, our ability to achieve and sustain profitability and operating leverage in part depends on our ability to increase our revenue through increased sales of Subscriptions on terms that maintain an adequate gross margin. Our license agreements that contain minimum guarantees typically have terms of between one and three years, but our Subscribers may cancel their subscriptions at any time. We rely on estimates to forecast whether such minimum guarantees and advances against royalties could be recouped against our actual content costs incurred over the term of the license agreement. To the extent that our estimates underperform relative to our expectations, and our content costs do not exceed such minimum guarantees and advance payments, our margins may be adversely affected. Some of our license agreements also include so-called \u201cmost-favored nations\u201d provisions, which require that certain terms (including material financial terms) are no less favorable than those provided to any similarly situated licensor. If agreements are amended or new agreements are entered into on more favorable terms, these most-favored nations provisions could cause our payment or other obligations to escalate substantially. Additionally, some of our license agreements require consent to undertake new business initiatives utilizing the licensed content (e.g., alternative distribution models), and without such consent, our ability to undertake new business initiatives may be limited and our competitive position could be impacted. If we breach any obligations in any of our license agreements, or if we use content in ways that are found to exceed the scope of such agreements, we could be subject to monetary penalties or claims of infringement, and our rights under such agreements could be terminated. In the past, we have entered into agreements that required us to make substantial payments to licensors to resolve instances of past use at the same time that we enter into go-forward licenses. These agreements may also include most-favored nations provisions. If triggered, these most favored nations provisions could cause our payments or other obligations under those agreements to escalate substantially. If we need to enter into additional similar agreements in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our business is affected by seasonality. Our business has historically been influenced by seasonal trends common to traditional retail selling periods, and we generate a disproportionate amount of sales activity related to our Connected Fitness Products during the period from November through February due in large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Year\u2019s resolutions, and cold weather. For example, we generated approximately 64%, 63%, and 63% of our full fiscal year total revenue during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, adverse events that occur during these months could have a disproportionate effect on our operating results for the entire fiscal year. Moreover, as a result of higher sales during the period from November through February, our working capital needs are greater during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. As a result of quarterly fluctuations caused by these and other factors, comparisons of our operating results 21 Table of Contents across different fiscal quarters may not be accurate indicators of our future performance. Furthermore, our rapid growth in recent years may obscure the extent to which seasonality trends have affected our business and may continue to affect our business. Accordingly, yearly or quarterly comparisons of our operating results may not be useful and our results in any particular period will not necessarily be indicative of the results to be expected for any future period. Seasonality in our business can also be affected by introductions of new or enhanced products and services, including the costs associated with such introductions. Our passion and focus on delivering a high-quality and engaging Peloton experience may not maximize short-term financial results, which may yield results that conflict with the market\u2019s expectations and could result in our stock price being negatively affected. We are passionate about continually enhancing the Peloton experience with a focus on driving long-term Member engagement through innovation, immersive content, technologically advanced Connected Fitness Products, and community support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve the Peloton experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our membership growth and Member engagement, and our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed. Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation. We offer complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by us, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products that we source from third parties. Any such defects could make our products and services unsafe, create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury, and subject us to the hazards and uncertainties of product liability claims and related litigation. In addition, from time to time we may experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors that affect our fitness and wellness programming. As a result, our services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software, and services we offer. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting our products and services and could lead to claims against us. We maintain general liability insurance; however, design and manufacturing defects, and claims related thereto, may subject us to judgments or settlements that result in damages materially in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. In addition, we may be exposed to recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses such as litigation costs and regulatory fines. If we cannot successfully defend any large claim, maintain our general liability insurance on acceptable terms, or maintain adequate coverage against potential claims, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Further, quality problems could adversely affect the experience for users of our products and services, and result in harm to our reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for our products and services, delay in new product and service introductions, and lost revenue. If we fail to offer high-quality Member support, our business and reputation will suffer. Once our Connected Fitness Products are purchased, our Members rely on our high-touch delivery and set up service to deliver and install their equipment in a professional and efficient manner. Our Members also rely on our support services to resolve any issues related to the use of our Connected Fitness Products and content. Providing a high-quality Member experience is vital to our success in generating word-of-mouth referrals to drive sales and for retaining existing Members. The importance of high-quality support will increase as we expand our business and introduce new products and services. If we do not help our Members quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our reputation may suffer and our ability to retain and attract Members, or to sell additional products and services to existing Members, could be harmed. 22 Table of Contents Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes these metrics difficult to predict. Our quarterly operating results and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Additionally, our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely on our past quarterly operating results as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial condition and operating results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including: [TABLE_92] \u2022 the continued market acceptance of, and the growth of the connected fitness and wellness market; [TABLE_93] \u2022 our ability to maintain and attract new Subscribers; [TABLE_94] \u2022 our development and improvement of the quality of the Peloton experience, including, enhancing existing and creating new Connected Fitness Products, services, technology, features, and content; [TABLE_95] \u2022 the continued development and upgrading of our proprietary technology platform; [TABLE_96] \u2022 the timing and success of new product, service, feature, and content introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market; [TABLE_97] \u2022 pricing pressure as a result of competition or otherwise; [TABLE_98] \u2022 delays or disruptions in our supply chain; [TABLE_99] \u2022 errors in our forecasting of the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenue or increased costs, or both; [TABLE_100] \u2022 increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive; [TABLE_101] \u2022 the ability to maintain and open new showrooms; [TABLE_102] \u2022 the continued maintenance and expansion of last mile delivery and maintenance services for our Connected Fitness Products; [TABLE_103] \u2022 successful expansion into international markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany; [TABLE_104] \u2022 seasonal fluctuations in subscriptions and usage of Connected Fitness Products by our Members, each of which may change as our products and services evolve or as our business grows; [TABLE_105] \u2022 the diversification and growth of our revenue sources; [TABLE_106] \u2022 our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins; [TABLE_107] \u2022 constraints on the availability of consumer financing or increased down payment requirements to finance purchases of our Connected Fitness Products; [TABLE_108] \u2022 system failures or breaches of security or privacy; [TABLE_109] \u2022 adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs, including content costs for past use; [TABLE_110] \u2022 changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, consumer product safety, and advertising, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees; [TABLE_111] \u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies; [TABLE_112] \u2022 changes in our effective tax rate; [TABLE_113] \u2022 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; and [TABLE_114] \u2022 changes in business or macroeconomic conditions, including lower consumer confidence, recessionary conditions, increased unemployment rates, or stagnant or declining wages. Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results. The variability and unpredictability of our quarterly operating results or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other operating results for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. 23 Table of Contents We rely on access to our production studios and the creativity of our fitness instructors to generate our class content. If we are unable to access or use our studios or if we are unable to attract and retain high-quality fitness instructors, we may not be able to generate interesting and attractive content for our classes. All of the fitness and wellness content offered on our platform is produced in one of our four production studios, three of which are located in New York City. Due to our reliance on a limited number of studios in a concentrated location, any incident involving our studios, or affecting New York City at-large, could render our studios inaccessible or unusable and could inhibit our ability to produce and deliver new fitness and wellness content for our Members. Production of the fitness and wellness content on our platform is further reliant on the creativity of our fitness instructors who, with the support of our production team, plan and lead our classes. Our standard employment contract with our fitness instructors has a fixed, multi-year term, however, our instructors may leave Peloton prior to the end of their contracts. If we are unable to attract or retain creative and experienced instructors, we may not be able to generate content on a scale or of a quality sufficient to grow our business. If we fail to produce and provide our Members with interesting and attractive content led by instructors who they can relate to, then our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected. We plan to expand into international markets, which will expose us to significant risks. We are currently expanding our operations to other countries, which requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, and political risks in addition to those we already face in the United States. There are significant risks and costs inherent in doing business in international markets, including: [TABLE_115] \u2022 difficulty establishing and managing international operations and the increased operations, travel, infrastructure, including establishment of local delivery service and customer service operations, and legal compliance costs associated with locations in different countries or regions; [TABLE_116] \u2022 the need to vary pricing and margins to effectively compete in international markets; [TABLE_117] \u2022 the need to adapt and localize products for specific countries, including obtaining rights to third-party intellectual property, including music, used in each country; [TABLE_118] \u2022 increased competition from local providers of similar products and services; [TABLE_119] \u2022 the ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights abroad; [TABLE_120] \u2022 the need to offer content and customer support in various languages; [TABLE_121] \u2022 difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations, and customs in other jurisdictions; [TABLE_122] \u2022 compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or U.K. Bribery Act, by us, our employees, and our business partners; [TABLE_123] \u2022 complexity and other risks associated with current and future legal requirements in other countries, including legal requirements related to consumer protection, consumer product safety, and data privacy frameworks, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation; [TABLE_124] \u2022 varying levels of internet technology adoption and infrastructure, and increased or varying network and hosting service provider costs; [TABLE_125] \u2022 tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules, as well as tax consequences; [TABLE_126] \u2022 fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the requirements of currency control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit conversion of other currencies into U.S. dollars; and [TABLE_127] \u2022 political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region in which we operate, including, for example, the effects of \u201cBrexit,\u201d which could have an adverse impact on our operations in that location. We have limited experience with international regulatory environments and market practices and may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in the markets we choose to enter. In addition, we may incur significant expenses as a result of our international expansion, and we may not be successful. We may face limited brand recognition in certain parts of the world that could lead to non-acceptance or delayed acceptance of our products and services by consumers in new markets. We may also face challenges to acceptance of our fitness and wellness content in new markets. Our failure to successfully manage these risks could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 24 Table of Contents Increases in component costs, long lead times, supply shortages, and supply changes could disrupt our supply chain and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Meeting customer demand partially depends on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our Connected Fitness Products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our Connected Fitness Products are sourced from a limited number of third-party suppliers, and some of these components are provided by a single supplier. Our manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf, subject to certain approved supplier lists, and we do not have long-term arrangements with most of our component suppliers. We are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our Connected Fitness Products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in design, quantities, and delivery schedules. We may in the future experience component shortages, and the predictability of the availability of these components may be limited. In the event of a component shortage or supply interruption from suppliers of these components, we may not be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner. Developing alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult, and costly and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may undermine our ability to fill our orders in a timely manner. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would harm our ability to meet our scheduled Connected Fitness Product deliveries to our customers. Moreover, volatile economic conditions may make it more likely that our suppliers may be unable to timely deliver supplies, or at all, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to timely locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Further, since the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S. and foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. Several of the components that go into the manufacturing of our Connected Fitness Products are sourced internationally, including from China, where the United States has imposed tariffs on specified products imported therefrom following the U.S. Trade Representative Section 301 Investigation. These tariffs have an impact on our component costs and have the potential to have an even greater impact depending on the outcome of the current trade negotiations, which have been protracted and recently resulted in increases in U.S. tariff rates on specified products from China. Increases in our component costs could have a material effect on our gross margins. The loss of a significant supplier, an increase in component costs, or delays or disruptions in the delivery of components, could adversely impact our ability to generate future revenue and earnings and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any major disruption or failure of our information technology systems or websites, or our failure to successfully implement upgrades and new technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and operations. Certain of our information technology systems are designed and maintained by us and are critical for the efficient functioning of our business, including the manufacture and distribution of our Connected Fitness Products, online sales of our Connected Fitness Products, and the ability of our Members to access content on our platform. Our rapid growth has, in certain instances, strained these systems. As we grow, we continue to implement modifications and upgrades to our systems, and these activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and upgrading these systems, including, but not limited to, impairment of our ability to fulfill customer orders and other disruptions in our business operations. Further, our system implementations may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. If we fail to successfully implement modifications and upgrades or expand the functionality of our information technology systems, we could experience increased costs associated with diminished productivity and operating inefficiencies related to the flow of goods through our supply chain. In addition, any unexpected technological interruptions to our systems or websites would disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, sell our Connected Fitness Products online, provide services to our Members, and otherwise adequately serve our Members. Online sales of our Connected Fitness Products through www.onepeloton.com represented over 50% of our units sold in the U.S. for fiscal 2019. The operation of our direct to consumer e-commerce business through our website depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of online order-taking and fulfillment operations. Any system interruptions or delays could prevent potential customers from purchasing our Connected Fitness Products. 25 Table of Contents Moreover, the ability of our Members to access the content on our platform could be diminished by a number of factors, including Members\u2019 inability to access the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches, or variability in Member traffic for our platform. Platform failures would be most impactful if they occurred during peak platform use periods, which generally occur before and after standard work hours. During these peak periods, there are a significant number of Members concurrently accessing our platform and if we are unable to provide uninterrupted access, our Members\u2019 perception of our platform\u2019s reliability may be damaged, our revenue could be reduced, our reputation could be harmed, and we may be required to issue credits or refunds, or risk losing Members. In the event we experience significant disruptions, we may be unable to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory. To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our suppliers and manufacturers, based on our estimates of future demand for particular products and services. Failure to accurately forecast our needs may result in manufacturing delays or increased costs. Our ability to accurately forecast demand could be affected by many factors, including changes in consumer demand for our products and services, changes in demand for the products and services of our competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. This risk may be exacerbated by the fact that we may not carry a significant amount of inventory and may not be able to satisfy short-term demand increases. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would cause our gross margins to suffer and could impair the strength and premium nature of our brand. Further, lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies, which could result in lower margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, our suppliers and manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements or we may be subject to higher costs in order to secure the necessary production capacity. An inability to meet consumer demand and delays in the delivery of our products to our customers could result in reputational harm and damaged customer relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. If we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our Connected Fitness Products and subscriptions, our business could be adversely affected. If we are unable to sustain pricing levels for our Bike, Tread, and subscription services, whether due to competitive pressure or otherwise, our gross margins could be significantly reduced. Further, our decisions around the development of new products and services are grounded in assumptions about eventual pricing levels. If there is price compression in the market after these decisions are made, it could have a negative effect on our business. Our revenue could decline due to changes in credit markets and decisions made by credit providers. Historically, a majority of our customers have financed their purchase of our Connected Fitness Products through third-party credit providers with whom we have existing relationships. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our financing partners, there is no guarantee that we will be able to find replacement partners who will provide our customers with financing on similar terms, and our ability to sell our Connected Fitness Products may be adversely affected. Further, reductions in consumer lending and the availability of consumer credit could limit the number of customers with the financial means to purchase our products. Higher interest rates could increase our costs or the monthly payments for consumer products financed through other sources of consumer financing. In the future, we cannot be assured that third-party financing providers will continue to provide consumers with access to credit or that available credit limits will not be reduced. Such restrictions or reductions in the availability of consumer credit, or the loss of our relationship with our current financing partners, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and operating results. 26 Table of Contents Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to identify, attract, develop, integrate, and retain qualified and highly skilled personnel, including senior management, engineers, producers, designers, product managers, logistics and supply chain personnel, retail managers, and fitness instructors. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of John Foley, our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, who is critical to the development of our business, future vision, and strategic direction. We also heavily rely on the continued service and performance of our senior management team, which provides leadership, contributes to the core areas of our business and helps us to efficiently execute our business. Also imperative to our success are our fitness instructors, who we rely on to bring new, exciting, and innovative fitness and wellness content to our platform, and who act as brand ambassadors. If the senior management team, including any new hires that we make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis then our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. Additionally, the loss of any key personnel could make it more difficult to manage our operations and research and development activities, reduce our employee retention and revenue, and impair our ability to compete. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially in New York City, where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our Class A common stock declines, it may adversely affect our ability to hire or retain highly skilled employees. In addition, we may periodically change our equity compensation practices, which may include reducing the number of employees eligible for equity awards or reducing the size of equity awards granted per employee. If we are unable to attract, integrate, or retain the qualified and highly skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. If we cannot maintain our \u201cOne Peloton\u201d culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, and passion that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed. We believe that a critical component of our success has been our corporate culture. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our \u201cOne Peloton\u201d culture, which is based on the idea that if we work together, we will be more efficient and perform better because of one another. As we continue to grow, including geographically expanding our presence outside of our headquarters in New York City, and developing the infrastructure associated with being a public company, we will need to maintain our \u201cOne Peloton\u201d culture among a larger number of employees, dispersed across various geographic regions. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. We have a limited operating history with which to evaluate and predict the profitability of our subscription model. Additionally, we may introduce new revenue models in the future. The majority of our Subscribers are on month-to-month subscription terms and may cancel their subscriptions at any time. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of Subscriber subscription renewals, so we may be unable to accurately predict customer renewal rates. Additionally, prior renewal rates may not accurately predict future Subscriber renewal rates for a variety of reasons, such as Subscribers\u2019 dissatisfaction with our offerings and the cost of our subscriptions, macroeconomic conditions, or new offering introductions by us or our competitors. If our Subscribers do not renew their subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our business will suffer. Furthermore, in the future, we may offer new subscription products, implement promotions, or replace or modify current subscription models, any of which could result in additional costs. It is unknown how our Subscribers will react to new models and whether the costs or logistics of implementing these models will adversely impact our business. If the adoption of new revenue models adversely impacts our Subscriber relationships, then Subscriber growth, Subscriber engagement, and our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed. 27 Table of Contents Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, a combination of trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, trade secret and patent laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, contractors, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, to establish and protect our brand and other intellectual property rights. However, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products, services, or technologies that are substantially similar to ours and that compete with our business. Effective protection of patents, trademarks, and domain names is expensive and difficult to maintain, both in terms of application and registration costs as well as the costs of defending and enforcing those rights. As we have grown, we have sought to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights in an increasing number of countries, a process that can be expensive and may not always be successful. For example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural requirements to complete the patent application process and to maintain issued patents, and noncompliance or non-payment could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in a relevant jurisdiction. Further, intellectual property protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products and services are available. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against certain third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. In order to protect our brand and intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously damage our brand and our business. We have been, and in the future may be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our market, and litigation, based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property, is frequent in the fitness and technology industries. Furthermore, it is common for individuals and groups to purchase patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like ours. Our use of third-party content, including music content, software, and other intellectual property rights may be subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation. We cannot guarantee that our internally developed or acquired technologies and content do not or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, our competitors or other third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our platform or services or using certain technologies, force us to implement expensive work-arounds, or impose other unfavorable terms. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for fitness products and services grows. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources. Further, during the course of any litigation, we may make announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments. If securities analysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. Even if intellectual property claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and require significant expenditures. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from competing effectively and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 28 Table of Contents We rely heavily on third parties for most of our computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have outsourced our cloud infrastructure to third-party providers, and we currently use these providers to host and stream our services and content. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and we expect to experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. Outages and capacity constraints could arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks. The level of service provided by these providers, or regular or prolonged interruptions in that service, could also affect the use of, and our Members\u2019 satisfaction with, our products and services and could harm our business and reputation. In addition, hosting costs will increase as membership engagement grows, which could harm our business if we are unable to grow our revenue faster than the cost of using these services or the services of similar providers. Furthermore, our providers have broad discretion to change and interpret the terms of service and other policies with respect to us, and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. Our providers may also take actions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more services, increasing pricing terms, terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether, or altering how we are able to process data in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. Although we expect that we could obtain similar services from other third parties, if our arrangements with our current providers were terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in our ability to make our content available to Members, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for alternative cloud infrastructure services. Any of these factors could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability, and cause our Subscribers to decline to renew their subscriptions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, customers of certain of our providers have been subject to litigation by third parties claiming that the service and basic HTTP functions infringe their patents. If we become subject to such claims, although we expect our provider to indemnify us with respect to at least a portion of such claims, the litigation may be time consuming, divert management\u2019s attention, and, if our provider failed to indemnify us, adversely impact our operating results. We face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we produce, license, and distribute through our platform. As a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright, and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we produce, license, and distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our service, including marketing materials. We may decide to remove content from our service, not to place certain content on our service, or to discontinue or alter our production of certain types of content if we believe such content might not be well received by our Members or could be damaging to our brand and business. To the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed from our service, or if we become liable for content we produce, license or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims. Some of our products and services contain open source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, technologies, products, and services in a manner that could harm our business. We use open source software in our products and services and anticipate using open source software in the future. Some open source software licenses require those who distribute open source software as part of their own software product to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software product or to make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject 29 Table of Contents have not been interpreted by U.S or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our products or services. Additionally, we could face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require us to expend significant additional research and development resources, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful. Additionally, the use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. There is typically no support available for open source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open source software will implement or push updates to address security risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our developers for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our products and services. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our Member engagement on mobile devices depends upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. A significant and growing portion of our Members access our platform through Peloton Digital and there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to support Peloton Digital or that mobile device users will use Peloton Digital rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of Peloton Digital with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, such as Android and iOS, and any changes in such systems that degrade the functionality of our digital offering or give preferential treatment to competitors could adversely affect our platform\u2019s usage on mobile devices. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality mobile content, it is important that our digital offering is designed effectively and works well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our Members to access and use our platform on their mobile devices or Members find our mobile offerings do not effectively meet their needs, our competitors develop products and services that are perceived to operate more effectively on mobile devices, or if our Members choose not to access or use our platform on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our platform, our Member growth and Member engagement could be adversely impacted. We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other Member data, which subjects us to legal obligations and laws and regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business. We collect, process, store, and use a wide variety of data from current and prospective Members, including personal information, such as home addresses and geolocation. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection, and e-commerce transactions require us to safeguard our Members\u2019 personal information. Although we have established security procedures to protect Member information, our or our third-party service providers\u2019 security and testing measures may not prevent security breaches. Further, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security, or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect Member data. Any compromise of our security or breach of our Members\u2019 privacy could harm our reputation or financial condition and, therefore, our business. In addition, a party who circumvents our security measures or exploits inadequacies in our security measures, could, among other effects, misappropriate Member data or other proprietary information, cause interruptions in our operations, or expose Members to computer viruses or other disruptions. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against 30 Table of Contents us. To the extent that the measures we or our third-party business partners have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation, breach notification obligations, or regulatory or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties, or damages and harm to our reputation. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our Member data, we may also have obligations to notify Members about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises Member data. Furthermore, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from individuals, privacy advocates, regulators, government agencies, and law enforcement agencies in various jurisdictions with conflicting privacy and security laws. This disclosure or refusal to disclose personal data may result in a breach of privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, court orders, and regulations and could result in proceedings or actions against us in the same or other jurisdictions, damage to our reputation and brand, and inability to provide our products and services to consumers in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, changes in the laws and regulations that govern our collection, use, and disclosure of Member data could impose additional requirements with respect to the retention and security of Member data, could limit our marketing activities, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations. Threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our products and services, as well as our servers, computer systems, and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber-attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, third-party or employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, unauthorized access to Member data, and loss of consumer confidence. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber-attack that attempts to obtain our or our Members\u2019 data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect our business, and financial condition and operating results, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation. In addition, any such breaches may result in negative publicity, and adversely affect our brand, impacting demand for our products and services, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We may be subject to warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns than expected, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We generally provide a minimum 12-month limited warranty on all of our Connected Fitness Products. The occurrence of any material defects in our Connected Fitness Products could make us liable for damages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, which could result in an adverse effect on our business prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and cash flows if warranty claims were to materially exceed anticipated levels. In addition, we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims, or other problems, including costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality and safety of our products could affect our brand image, decrease consumer and Member confidence and demand, and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Also, while our warranty is limited to repairs and returns, warranty claims may result in litigation, the occurrence of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition to warranties supplied by us, we also offer the option for customers to purchase third-party extended warranty and services contracts in some markets, which creates an ongoing performance obligation over the warranty period. Extended warranties are regulated in the United States on a state level and are treated differently by state. Outside the United States, regulations for extended warranties vary from country to country. Changes in interpretation of the insurance 31 Table of Contents regulations or other laws and regulations concerning extended warranties on a federal, state, local, or international level may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future. Our failure to comply with past, present, and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, reputational damage, penalties, and other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We or our Subscribers may be subject to sales and other taxes, and we may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees. The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, subscription sales tax, value-added tax, provincial taxes, goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours and to our Subscribers is a complex and evolving issue. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business. One or more states, the federal government, or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that offer subscription services and other fitness offerings. New taxes could also require us to incur substantial costs to capture data and collect and remit taxes. If such obligations were imposed, the additional costs associated with tax collection, remittance, and audit requirements could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We continue to analyze our exposure for taxes and liabilities and have accrued $5.7 million and $4.1 million for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively, for loss contingencies resulting from potential taxes and liabilities. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur significant expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention, and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. From time to time, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving products liability, competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, securities, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, and other matters that could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries. Litigation and regulatory proceedings, and particularly the intellectual property infringement matters that we are currently facing or could face, may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages and include claims for injunctive relief. Additionally, our litigation costs could be significant. Adverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments, penalties and fines, or require us to modify our products or services, make content unavailable, or require us to stop offering certain features, all of which could negatively affect our membership and revenue growth. See the section titled \u201cBusiness\u2014Legal Proceedings\u201d The results of litigation, investigations, claims, and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and determining reserves for pending litigation and other legal and regulatory matters requires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Changes in how we market our products and services could adversely affect our marketing expenses and subscription levels. We use a broad mix of marketing and other brand-building measures to attract Members. We use traditional television and online advertising, as well as third-party social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as marketing tools. As television advertising, online, and social media platforms continue to rapidly evolve or grow more competitive, we must continue to maintain a presence on these platforms and establish a presence on new or emerging popular social media and advertising and marketing platforms. If we cannot cost effectively use these marketing tools or if we fail to promote our products and services efficiently and effectively, our ability to acquire new Members and our financial condition may suffer. In addition, an increase in the use of television, online, and social media for product promotion and marketing may increase the burden on us to monitor compliance of such materials and increase the risk that such materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in violation of applicable regulations. 32 Table of Contents An economic downturn or economic uncertainty may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products and services. Our products and services may be considered discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, and other factors, such as consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession, the availability and cost of consumer credit, levels of unemployment, and tax rates. In recent years, the United States and other significant economic markets have experienced cyclical downturns and worldwide economic conditions remain uncertain. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions. To date, our business has operated almost exclusively in a relatively strong economic environment and, therefore, we cannot be sure the extent to which we may be affected by recessionary conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions may lead consumers to delay or reduce purchases of our products and services and consumer demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand for our products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Covenants in the loan and security agreement governing our revolving credit facility may restrict our operations, and if we do not effectively manage our business to comply with these covenants, our financial condition could be adversely impacted. We entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement, the Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and Silicon Valley Bank in June 2019, which amended and restated the loan and security agreement that we previously entered into in November 2017, providing for a $250 million secured revolving line of credit. The term loan and revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants, including, among other things, minimum liquidity and revenue requirements, restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets, make acquisitions or investments, incur debt or liens, make distributions to our stockholders, or enter into certain types of related party transactions. These restrictions may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry, or take future actions. Pursuant to the agreement, we granted the parties thereto a security interest in substantially all of our assets. See the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014Credit Agreement\u201d for additional information. Our ability to meet these restrictive covenants can be impacted by events beyond our control and we may be unable to do so. Our loan and security agreement provide that our breach or failure to satisfy certain covenants constitutes an event of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under its debt agreements to be immediately due and payable. In addition, our lenders would have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the loan and security agreement. If the debt under our loan and security agreement was to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay it, which would have an immediate adverse effect on our business and operating results. This could potentially cause us to cease operations and result in a complete loss of your investment in our Class A common stock. We may engage in merger and acquisition activities, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results. As part of our business strategy, we acquired our first company in 2018 and have made or may make investments in other companies, products, or technologies in the future. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, in the future. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by Members or investors. Moreover, an acquisition, investment, or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations, diverting management from their primary responsibilities, subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized, if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company. To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt 33 Table of Contents it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Additionally, we may receive indications of interest from other parties interested in acquiring some or all of our business. The time required to evaluate such indications of interest could require significant attention from management, disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We may require additional capital to support business growth and objectives, and this capital might not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, and may result in stockholder dilution. We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. However, we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional capital to fund our business and to respond to competitive challenges, including the need to promote our products and services, develop new products and services, enhance our existing products, services, and operating infrastructure, and potentially to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. There can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Our inability to obtain additional funding when needed could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, holders of our Class A common stock could suffer significant dilution, and any new shares we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We are subject to payment processing risk. Our customers pay for our products and services using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, and online wallets. We rely on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are disruptions in our payment processing systems, increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation could be adversely impacted. We leverage our third-party payment processors to bill Subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact Subscriber acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operation and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. Our ability to use our net operating loss to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. As of June 30, 2019, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and state NOLs of approximately $112.6 million and $95.8 million, respectively, due to prior period losses which if not utilized will begin to expire for federal and state tax purposes beginning in 2036 and 2021, respectively. Realization of these NOLs depends on future income, and there is a risk that our existing NOLs could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have undergone two ownership changes on November 30, 2015 and April 18, 2017 and our NOLs arising before those dates are subject to one or more Section 382 limitations which may materially limit the use of such NOLs to offset our future taxable income. In addition, this offering, as well as future changes in our stock ownership, the causes of which may be outside of our control, could result in an additional ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be impaired under state laws. In addition, under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. This change 34 Table of Contents may require us to pay federal income taxes in future years despite generating a loss for federal income tax purposes. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability. We may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. While we have historically transacted in U.S. dollars with the majority of our Subscribers and suppliers, we have transacted in some foreign currencies, such as the Canadian Dollar and U.K Pound Sterling, and may transact in more foreign currencies in the future. Further, certain of our manufacturing agreements provide for fixed costs of our Connected Fitness Products and hardware in Taiwanese dollars but provide for payment in U.S. dollars based on the then-current Taiwanese dollar to U.S. dollar spot rate. Accordingly, changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can affect our revenue and operating results. As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and operating results. In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates cause our operating results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our Class A common stock could be lowered. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies. However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments. We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets. The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the import or export of certain technologies. Our products may be subject to U.S. export controls, which may require submission of a product classification and annual or semi-annual reports. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products and services may create delays in the introduction of our products and services in international markets, prevent our international Members from accessing our products and services, and, in some cases, prevent the export of our products and services to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions, our products and services, including our firmware updates, could be provided to those targets or provided by our Members. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue. We could be subject to future enforcement action with respect to compliance with governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on export privileges that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the FCPA and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. We operate a global business and may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. These laws that prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from corruptly promising, authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties, and private-sector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to any person, or securing any advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate 35 Table of Contents system of internal accounting controls. In many foreign countries, including countries in which we may conduct business, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. We face significant risks if we or any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or other partners or representatives fail to comply with these laws and governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. We have begun to implement an anti-corruption compliance program and policies, procedures and training designed to foster compliance with these laws, however, our employees, contractors, and agents, and companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law. Any such violation could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. Any violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results, and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Changes in legislation in U.S. and foreign taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies, as well as the application of such laws, could adversely impact our financial position and operating results. Recent or future changes to U.S., U.K. and other foreign tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. We generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries, branches, or representative offices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Further, we are in the process of implementing an international structure that aligns with our financial and operational objectives as evaluated based on our international markets, expansion plans, and operational needs for headcount and physical infrastructure outside the United States. The intercompany relationships between our legal entities are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Although we believe we are compliant with applicable transfer pricing and other tax laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other relevant countries, due to changes in such laws and rules, we may have to modify our international structure in the future, which will incur costs, may increase our worldwide effective tax rate, and may adversely affect our financial position and operating results. In addition, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles, and interpretations. As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm\u2019s-length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. If U.S., U.K., or other foreign tax laws further change, if our current or future structures and arrangements are challenged by a taxing authority, or if we are unable to appropriately adapt the manner in which we operate our business, we may have to undertake further costly modifications to our international structure and our tax liabilities and operating results may be adversely affected. The requirements of being a public company, including maintaining adequate internal control over our financial and management systems, may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members. As a public company we will incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will be subject to reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the 36 Table of Contents Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the rules and regulations of the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will likely strain our financial and management systems, internal controls, and employees. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. Moreover, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control, over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over, financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal 2018, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If, in the future, we have material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Effective internal control is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important to prevent fraud. In addition, we will be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when we cease to be an emerging growth company. We expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Although we have already hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, our finance team is small and we may need to hire more employees in the future, or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. We also expect that being a public company and complying with applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantially higher costs to obtain and maintain the same or similar coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if our remediation of such material weaknesses is not effective, or if we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired. In the course of preparing our financial statements for fiscal 2018, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness had not been remediated as of June 30, 2019. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified relate to information technology general controls, controls to address segregation of certain accounting duties, timely reconciliation and analysis of certain key accounts and the review of journal entries. We have concluded that these material weaknesses arose because, as a private company, we did not have the necessary business processes, systems, personnel and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company. To address our material weaknesses, we have added personnel as well as implemented new financial systems and processes. We intend to continue to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses described above through hiring additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel, and further evolving our accounting processes. We will not be able to fully remediate these material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or 37 Table of Contents maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and stockholders\u2019 equity/deficit, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue related reserves, content costs for past use reserve, fair value measurements including common stock valuations, useful lives of property plant and equipment, product warranty, goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense and commitments and contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. Our reported financial results may be negatively impacted by the changes in GAAP. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, or Topic 842, Leases , which requires recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet by lessees for leases classified as operating leases with a term of more than 12 months. Topic 842 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We early adopted this standard as of July 1, 2019. The most significant change related to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for real estate operating leases, as well as the de-recognition of the build-to-suit asset and liability. See Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for additional information. The forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, we cannot assure you that our business will grow at a similar rate, if at all. Growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The forecasts in this prospectus relating to the expected growth in the connected fitness and wellness market, including estimates based on our own internal survey data, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the market experiences the forecasted growth described in this prospectus, we may not grow our business at a similar rate, or at all. Our growth is 38 Table of Contents subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this prospectus should not be taken as indicative of our future growth. Our management team has limited experience managing a public company. Most members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism. Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins, and similar events. The third-party systems and operations and manufacturers we rely on are subject to similar risks. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could also cause disruptions in our or our suppliers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting locations that store significant inventory of our products, that house our servers, or from which we generate content. As we rely heavily on our computer and communications systems, and the internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, these disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt suppliers\u2019 and manufacturers\u2019 businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. We are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which will require us to conduct due diligence on and disclose whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such due diligence activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes, or sources of supply to avoid such materials. Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock There has been no prior public market for our Class A common stock, the stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price. There has been no public market for our Class A common stock prior to this offering. The initial public offering price for our Class A common stock was determined through negotiations between us and the underwriters and may vary from the market price of our Class A common stock following this offering. The market prices of the securities of newly public companies such as us have historically been highly volatile. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: [TABLE_128] \u2022 overall performance of the equity markets and the performance of technology companies in particular; 39 Table of Contents [TABLE_129] \u2022 variations in our operating results, cash flows, and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations; [TABLE_130] \u2022 changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections; [TABLE_131] \u2022 failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; [TABLE_132] \u2022 recruitment or departure of key personnel; [TABLE_133] \u2022 the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry; [TABLE_134] \u2022 negative publicity related to problems in our manufacturing or the real or perceived quality of our products, as well as the failure to timely launch new products or services that gain market acceptance; [TABLE_135] \u2022 rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; [TABLE_136] \u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of new products, services, features and content, significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; [TABLE_137] \u2022 new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; [TABLE_138] \u2022 lawsuits threatened or filed against us, litigation involving our industry, or both; [TABLE_139] \u2022 developments or disputes concerning our or other parties\u2019 products, services, or intellectual property rights; [TABLE_140] \u2022 other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; [TABLE_141] \u2022 the expiration of contractual lock-up or market standoff agreements; and [TABLE_142] \u2022 sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business. Sales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial amount of our Class A common stock in the public markets by our existing security holders may cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing security holders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold, and may take, or attempt to take, steps to sell, directly or indirectly, their shares or otherwise secure, or limit the risk to, the value of their unrecognized gains on those shares. Based on zero shares of our Class A common stock and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, we will have ( shares if the option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full) of our Class A common stock and shares of our Class B common stock outstanding after this offering. All of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act except that any shares held by our affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, would only be able to be sold in compliance with Rule 144 and any applicable lock-up agreements described below. Approximately shares of Class A common stock, assuming no exercise of outstanding options, will be immediately available for sale in the public market. Approximately shares of our common stock are also subject to the lock-up agreement or market standoff agreements described below. In connection with this offering, subject to certain customary exceptions, we, all of our directors and executive officers, and substantially all of the holders of our common stock, or securities exercisable for or convertible into our common stock outstanding immediately prior to this offering, have entered into market standoff agreements with us or lock-up agreements with the underwriters that prohibit from selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the sale of, transferring, or otherwise disposing of any shares of common stock, stock options, or any security or instrument related to common stock 40 Table of Contents or stock options without the permission of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC on behalf of the underwriters for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, subject to early termination as described below. We have a large number of security holders and such security holders have acquired their interests over an extended period of time and pursuant to a number of different agreements containing a variety of terms governing restrictions on the sale, short sale, transfer, hedging, pledging, or other disposition of their interests in our equity. Holders of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock are subject to restrictions on their ability to sell or transfer their equity either prior to the pricing of this offering or from the pricing of this offering through the date that is 180 days after the date of this prospectus. We refer to such period as the lock-up period. Pursuant to the lock-up agreements with the underwriters, if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (3) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a broadly applicable period during which trading in our securities would not be permitted under our insider trading policy, or a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. We and the underwriters may release certain stockholders from the market standoff agreements or lock-up agreements prior to the end of the lock-up period. Record holders of our securities are typically the parties to the lock-up agreements with the underwriters and to the market standoff agreements with us referred to above, while holders of beneficial interests in our shares who are not also holders in respect of such shares are not typically subject to any such agreements or other similar restrictions. Accordingly, we believe that holders of beneficial interests who are not holders and are not bound by market standoff or lock-up agreements could enter into transactions with respect to those beneficial interests that negatively impact our stock price. In addition, an equity holder who is neither subject to a market standoff agreement with us nor a lock-up agreement with the underwriters may be able to sell, short sell, transfer, hedge, pledge, or otherwise dispose of or attempt to sell, short sell, transfer, hedge, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, their equity interests at any time after the closing of this offering. Any such transaction described above involving shares of our Class A common stock, or any perception by the market that such transaction may occur, could cause our stock price to decline. When the applicable lock-up and market standoff periods described above expire, we and our security holders subject to a lock-up agreement or market standoff agreement will be able to sell our shares in the public market. In addition, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, on behalf of the underwriters, may, in their sole discretion, release all or some portion of the shares subject to lock-up agreements prior to the expiration of the lock-up period. Sales of a substantial number of such shares upon expiration of the lock-up and market standoff agreements, or the perception that such sales may occur, or early release of these agreements, could cause our market price to fall or make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. In addition, as of June 30, 2019, we had stock options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of 64,602,124 shares of Class B common stock. All of the shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, will be registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance subject to existing lock-up or market standoff agreements and applicable vesting requirements. Immediately following this offering, the holders of shares of our Class B common stock will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements for the public resale of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of such shares or to include such shares in registration statements that we may file for us or other stockholders. We may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, or otherwise. Any further issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. 41 Table of Contents The dual class structure of our common stock will have the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, including our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders who will hold in the aggregate % of the voting power of our capital stock following the completion of this offering, which will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors and the approval of any change of control transaction. Our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the stock we are offering in this offering, has one vote per share. Following this offering, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock will hold % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, with our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates, holding in the aggregate % of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the twenty-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) ten years from the closing of this offering, and (iii) the date the shares of Class B common stock cease to represent at least 1% of all outstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. See the section titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock\u2014Anti-Takeover Provisions\u201d for additional information. The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock. Certain stock index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones, exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to certain stock indices, including the S&P 500. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors oppose the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may prevent the inclusion of our Class A common stock in such indices, may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure, and may result in large institutional investors not purchasing shares of our Class A common stock. Any exclusion from stock indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A common stock. Any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms or institutional investors critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could also adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and intend to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies which may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors. We are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of this offering; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including: [TABLE_143] \u2022 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; [TABLE_144] \u2022 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and [TABLE_145] \u2022 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We currently intend to take advantage of the available exemptions described above. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that 42 Table of Contents would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. Furthermore, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this accommodation allowing for delayed adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of these decisions, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and the price of our Class A common stock may be more volatile. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market, and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline. An active public trading market may not develop or be sustained following this offering. Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock. We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, however, an active trading market may not develop following the completion of this offering or, if developed, may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the market price of your shares of Class A common stock. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares or to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration. We cannot predict the prices at which our Class A common stock will trade. The initial public offering price of our Class A common stock will be determined by negotiations between us and the underwriters and may not bear any relationship to the market price at which our Class A common stock will trade after this offering or to any other established criteria of the value of our business and prospects. Because the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock following this offering, new investors will experience immediate and substantial dilution. The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately following this offering based on the total value of our tangible assets less our total liabilities. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our Class A common stock in this offering, based on the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and the issuance by us of shares of Class A common stock in this offering, you will experience immediate dilution of $ per share, the difference between the price per share you pay for our Class A common stock and its pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2019. Furthermore, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares, if outstanding stock options are exercised, if we issue awards to our employees under our equity incentive plans, or if we otherwise issue additional shares of our Class A common stock, you could experience further dilution. See the section titled \u201cDilution\u201d for additional information. We will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds we receive in this offering and may not use them effectively. We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive in this offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section titled \u201cUse of Proceeds,\u201d and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. If we do not use the net proceeds that we receive in this offering effectively, our business, financial 43 Table of Contents condition, operating results, and prospects could be harmed, and the market price for our Class A common stock could decline. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government that may not generate a high yield to our stockholders. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors. We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by the restrictions under the terms of our loan and security agreement. We anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, and limit the market price of our Class A common stock. Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws that will be in effect upon the completion of this offering may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or other change of control of our company that the stockholders may consider favorable. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws include provisions that: [TABLE_146] \u2022 provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; [TABLE_147] \u2022 permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships; [TABLE_148] \u2022 require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws; [TABLE_149] \u2022 authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; [TABLE_150] \u2022 provide that only the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; [TABLE_151] \u2022 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; [TABLE_152] \u2022 prohibit cumulative voting; [TABLE_153] \u2022 provide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders; [TABLE_154] \u2022 provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock may have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets; [TABLE_155] \u2022 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; [TABLE_156] \u2022 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws; and [TABLE_157] \u2022 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any 44 Table of Contents action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not preclude the filing of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder in federal court. Moreover, Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. See the section titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock\u201d for additional information. 45 Table of Contents SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus contains forward-looking statements.

We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this prospectus. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those described in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or 46 Table of Contents achievements. We undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this prospectus or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in this prospectus and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. 47 Table of Contents INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus concerning our industry and the markets in which we operate, including our general expectations, market position, market opportunity, and market size, is based on information from various sources, including our own estimates, as well as assumptions that we have made that are based on such data and other similar sources, and on our knowledge of the market for our products and services. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. While we believe the market position, market opportunity, and market size information included in this prospectus is generally reliable, information of this sort is inherently imprecise. In addition, projections, assumptions, and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industry in which we operate is necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this prospectus. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us. This prospectus contains statistical data, estimates, and forecasts that are based on industry publications or reports generated by third-party providers, or other publicly available information, as well as other information based on internal estimates. The sources of certain statistical data, estimates, and forecasts contained in this prospectus are provided below: [TABLE_175] \u2022 Global Wellness Institute, Wellness Now a $4.2 Trillion Global Industry , October 2018.

[TABLE_179] \u2022 Pew Research Center, 7 Facts About American Dads , June 2018. [TABLE_180] \u2022 The following reports from The International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association: The 2019 IHRSA Global Report, the 2018 IHRSA Health Club Consumer Report , 2018 IHRSA Global Report , IHRSA\u2019s Guide to the Boutique Studio , and 2009 IHRSA Global Report . Statistics and estimates related to our TAM and SAM are based on internal reports conducted with the assistance of our third-party marketing partner, Directions Research, Inc. In order to determine our TAM and SAM, we conducted an online survey of consumers across the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada, surveying over 1,000 consumers in each market. Consumers who qualified for our study were (i) between the ages of 18 and 70 years old and (ii) had self-reported household annual pre-tax incomes of $50,000 or more, or the foreign equivalent. Consumer responses to the survey were used as the basis for determining our TAM and SAM by weighting such responses to population censuses based on age and/or income. To calculate our TAM, we multiplied the percentage of respondents who reported having broadband internet and being open to subscription fitness by total households represented in the survey, and then weighted the response based on the relevant population censuses. To calculate our SAM, we measured the percentage of the TAM population who expressed interest in purchasing products within one of our existing categories. To better estimate a respondent\u2019s likelihood to purchase one of our Connected Fitness Products, we made certain downward adjustments based on industry probability purchase assumptions, to account for conflicting responses from individual respondents, and where a respondent\u2019s response relating to how much he or she would pay for a Peloton product was below the mean stated price by one standard deviation or more. Once each respondent\u2019s probability of purchasing each product was determined, we weighted the responses based on the relevant population. We calculate the expected SAM for our product portfolio by multiplying the average weighted purchase probability for each product by the total country TAM. Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included elsewhere in this prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables or charts may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them. 48 Table of Contents USE OF PROCEEDS We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $ million, or $ million if the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $ million, assuming the number of shares of our Class A common stock offered by us remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares of our Class A common stock offered by us would increase (decrease) the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $ million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price of $ remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock, and enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We primarily intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include research and development and sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions, or businesses that complement our business. However, we do not have binding agreements or commitments for any acquisitions or investments outside the ordinary course of business at this time. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. DIVIDEND POLICY We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. See the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information. 49 Table of Contents CAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of June 30, 2019 on: [TABLE_181] \u2022 an actual basis; [TABLE_182] \u2022 a pro forma basis to give effect to (1) the redesignation of our outstanding common stock as Class B common stock in 2019, (2) the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019 into 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common stock, and (3) the filing and effectiveness of our restated certificate of incorporation; and [TABLE_183] \u2022 a pro forma as adjusted basis to give effect to the adjustments described above as well as the sale and issuance by us of shares of our Class A common stock offered in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. The pro forma as adjusted information below is illustrative only, and our cash and cash equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity, and total capitalization following the completion of this offering will be adjusted based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of the offering determined at the pricing of this offering. You should read this table together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes, and the sections titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d each included elsewhere in this prospectus.

Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted cash and cash equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity, and total capitalization by approximately $ million, assuming that the assumed initial public offering price, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. If the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, the pro forma as adjusted amount of each of cash and cash equivalents, additional paid-in capital, total stockholders\u2019 (deficit) equity, and total capitalization would increase by approximately $ , after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and we would have shares of our Class A common stock and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock issued and outstanding, pro forma as adjusted. The number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based upon zero shares of our Class A common stock outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, in each case, as of June 30, 2019 and does not include: [TABLE_186] \u2022 64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with a weighted-average exercise price of $6.71 per share; [TABLE_187] \u2022 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted between June 30, 2019 and August 26, 2019 with an exercise price of $22.05 per share; [TABLE_188] \u2022 240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase Class B common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share; and [TABLE_189] \u2022 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans, consisting of (1) 9,085,593 shares of our Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015 Plan as of June 30, 2019 (which reserve does not reflect the options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted after June 30, 2019), (2) shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2019 Plan, which will become effective on the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, and (3) shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 ESPP, which will become effective on the date of this prospectus. On the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, any remaining shares available for issuance under our 2015 Plan will be added to the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan, and we will cease granting awards under the 2015 Plan. Our 2019 Plan and 2019 ESPP also provide for automatic annual increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder. See the section titled \u201cExecutive Compensation\u2014Employee Benefit Plans\u201d for additional information. 51 Table of Contents DILUTION If you invest in our Class A common stock, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of Class A common stock in this initial public offering and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of Class A common stock immediately after this offering. As of June 30, 2019, our pro forma net tangible book value was approximately $378.8 million, or $1.61 per share of common stock. Our pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total liabilities and divided by the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019 after giving effect to (1) the redesignation of our outstanding common stock as Class B common stock on , 2019, (2) the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019 into 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common stock, and (3) the filing and effectiveness of our restated certificate of incorporation. After giving effect to our sale in this offering of shares of our Class A common stock, at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of June 30, 2019 would have been approximately $ million, or $ per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $ per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $ per share to investors purchasing Class A common stock in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price. The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis to new investors: [TABLE_190] Assumed initial public offering price per share $ Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2019, before giving effect to this offering $ Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to new investors in this offering Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share Dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share to new investors in this offering $ A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range reflected on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering by $ per share and would increase (decrease) the dilution per share to new investors in this offering by $ per share, assuming the number of shares of Class A common stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. Similarly, each increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares in the number of shares of Class A common stock offered by us would increase (decrease) the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering by $ per share and would increase (decrease) the dilution to new investors by $ per share, assuming the assumed initial public offering price, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering would be $ per share and the dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to investors in this offering would be $ per share. The following table summarizes, on a pro forma as adjusted basis as of June 30, 2019, after giving effect to the pro forma adjustments described above, the difference between existing stockholders and new investors purchasing shares of Class A common stock in this offering with respect to the number of shares purchased from us, the total consideration paid to us, and the average price per share paid by our existing stockholders or to be paid by investors purchasing shares in this 52 Table of Contents offering at an assumed offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, before deducting the estimated underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses: [TABLE_191] Shares Purchased Total Consideration Average Price Per Share Number Percent Amount Percent Existing stockholders % $ % $ New investors Total 100% $ 100% A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) total consideration paid by new investors and total consideration paid by all stockholders by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount. Except as otherwise indicated, the above discussion and tables assume no exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, our existing stockholders would own % and our new investors would own % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering. In addition, to the extent we issue any additional stock options or any outstanding stock options or warrant are exercised, or we issue any other securities or convertible debt in the future, investors will experience further dilution. The number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based upon zero shares of our Class A common stock outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, in each case, as of June 30, 2019: [TABLE_192] \u2022 64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with a weighted-average exercise price of $6.71 per share; [TABLE_193] \u2022 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted between June 30, 2019 and August 26, 2019 with an exercise price of $22.05 per share; [TABLE_194] \u2022 240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase Class B common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share; and [TABLE_195] \u2022 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans, consisting of (1) 9,085,593 shares of our Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015 Plan as of June 30, 2019 (which reserve does not reflect the options to purchase shares of our Class B common stock granted after June 30, 2019), (2) shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2019 Plan, which will become effective on the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, and (3) shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 ESPP, which will become effective on the date of this prospectus. On the date immediately prior to the date of this prospectus, any remaining shares available for issuance under our 2015 Plan will be added to the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan, and we will cease granting awards under the 2015 Plan. Our 2019 Plan and 2019 ESPP also provide for automatic annual increases in the number of shares reserved thereunder. See the section titled \u201cExecutive Compensation\u2014Employee Benefit Plans\u201d for additional information. 53 Table of Contents SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA The following tables present selected historical financial and other data for our business.

[TABLE_205] (4) See Note 16 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for an explanation of the calculations of our net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted, and pro forma net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude: interest income, net; other income, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; costs related to acquisitions; certain litigation expenses, consisting of legal settlements and related fees for specific proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business; and the ground lease expense related to build-to-suit lease obligations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as measures of operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons: [TABLE_207] \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company\u2019s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other (income) expense, net, and provision for income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired; [TABLE_208] \u2022 our management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; and [TABLE_209] \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin provide consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and also facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are, or may in the future be, as follows: [TABLE_210] \u2022 although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; [TABLE_211] \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; [TABLE_212] \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; [TABLE_213] \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect certain litigation expenses, consisting of legal settlements and related fees for specific proceedings, that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business; [TABLE_214] \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the non-cash ground lease expense related to our new corporate headquarters lease whereby we are considered, for accounting purposes only, the owner of the construction project under current build-to-suit lease accounting; [TABLE_215] \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect transaction costs related to acquisitions; and [TABLE_216] \u2022 the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results and we may, in the future, exclude other significant, unusual or non-recurring expenses or other items from these financial measures. 57 Table of Contents Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP, for each of the periods indicated: [TABLE_217] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (dollars in millions) Net loss (1) $ (71.1 ) $ (47.9 ) $ (195.6 ) Adjusted to exclude the following: Other (expense) income, net (0.3 ) (0.3 ) 6.7 Provision for income taxes \u2014 0.1 0.1 Depreciation and amortization expense 3.7 6.6 21.7 Stock-based compensation expense 10.3 8.5 89.5 Transaction costs \u2014 0.5 0.4 Litigation expenses 5.0 1.5 12.1 Ground lease expense related to build-to-suit obligations \u2014 \u2014 7.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ (51.8 ) $ (30.4 ) $ (71.3 ) Adjusted EBITDA Margin (23.7 )% (7.0 )% (7.8 )% [TABLE_218] (1) Included in net loss are content costs for past use as follows: [TABLE_219] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (in millions) Content costs for past use (1) $ 15.5 $ 14.5 $ 16.4 [TABLE_220] (1) From time-to-time, we execute music royalty agreements with various music rights holders. As part of these go-forward license agreements, we may also enter into agreements whereby we are released from all potential licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We refer to these payments as content costs for past use. Included in Adjusted EBITDA are content costs for past use. These costs had a negative basis point impact on Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 711, 333, and 180 for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin We define Subscription Contribution as subscription revenue less cost of subscription revenue, adjusted to exclude from cost of subscription revenue, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Subscription Contribution Margin is calculated by dividing Subscription Contribution by subscription revenue. We use Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin to measure our ability to scale and leverage the costs of our Connected Fitness Subscriptions and measure Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results because our management uses Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. Our use of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: [TABLE_221] \u2022 although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and 58 Table of Contents [TABLE_222] \u2022 Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. Because of these limitations, Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of Subscription Contribution to subscription gross profit, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP, for each of the periods indicated: [TABLE_223] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (dollars in millions) Subscription revenue $ 32.5 $ 80.3 $ 181.1 Less: Cost of subscription (1) 29.3 45.5 103.7 Subscription gross profit 3.2 34.7 77.4 Subscription gross margin 9.7 % 43.3 % 42.7 % Adjusted to exclude the following: Depreciation and amortization expense $ 1.2 $ 2.8 $ 11.3 Stock-based compensation expense 0.1 0.5 3.2 Subscription Contribution $ 4.4 $ 38.0 $ 91.9 Subscription Contribution Margin 13.5 % 47.5 % 50.8 % [TABLE_224] (1) Included in cost of subscription are content costs for past use as follows: [TABLE_225] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (in millions) Content costs for past use (1) $ 15.5 $ 14.5 $ 16.4 [TABLE_226] (1) From time-to-time, we execute music royalty agreements with various music rights holders. As part of these go-forward license agreements, we may also enter into agreements whereby we are released from all potential licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We refer to these payments as content costs for past use. Included in Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin are content costs for past use. These costs had a negative basis point impact on Subscription Contribution Margin of 4,788, 1,805, and 908 for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. 59 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Our fiscal year end is June 30, and our fiscal quarters end on September 30, December 31, March 31, and June 30. Our fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019 are referred to herein as fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, respectively. Overview of Our Business and History Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the best versions of themselves. Key milestones in our growth history include: 60 Table of Contents [TABLE_227] * We define a Member as any individual who has a Peloton account. We define a Connected Fitness Subscriber as either a paid Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers) or a paused Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription where the Subscriber has requested to \u201cPause\u201d for up to 3 months). We define a Digital Subscriber as an individual or household that has a paid Peloton Digital subscription with a successful credit card billing. [TABLE_228] ** Total Global Subscribers represents the aggregate number of Connected Fitness Subscribers and Digital Subscribers. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 613,000 Global Subscribers. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have experienced significant growth in sales of our Connected Fitness Products, which, when combined with our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn has led to significant growth in Connected Fitness Subscribers. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, total revenue grew 110%, and our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew 108%. For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019: [TABLE_229] \u2022 We generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3% year-over-year growth; [TABLE_230] \u2022 As of June 30, 2017, June 30, 2018, and June 30, 2019, we had 107,708, 245,667, and 511,202 Connected Fitness Subscribers, respectively, representing 128.1% and 108.1% year-over-year growth; [TABLE_231] \u2022 Our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn was 0.70%, 0.64%, and 0.65%, respectively; [TABLE_232] \u2022 We incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and $(195.6) million, respectively; and [TABLE_233] \u2022 Our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3) million, respectively. For a definition of Connected Fitness Subscribers, Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, Subscription Contribution Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA, see the section titled \u201c\u2014Key Operational and Business Metrics.\u201d See the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. As a supplement to our key operational and business metrics described herein, we also measure our number of Members to understand the scale of our platform and market penetration. Unlike our number of Connected Fitness Subscriptions or Digital Subscriptions, a Member represents a single individual who has a Peloton account. It is often the case that a Connected Fitness Subscription or Digital Subscription is used by multiple members of a single family that each have individual Peloton accounts. As of June 30, 2019, we had over 1.4 million Members and the average Connected Fitness Subscription was used by 2.0 Members. Our Business Model Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer acquisition. Grow Our Connected Fitness Subscriber Base We are still in the early stages of growth. As of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products globally, a small fraction of the 14 million products we believe reflect our SAM in our current and announced markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany) and current fitness product verticals. We believe our success in growing our Connected Fitness Subscriber base is due to our data-driven marketing and education-based multi-channel sales efforts, word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, and broadening customer demographics. In order to grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber base, we plan to drive sales of our Connected Fitness Products by continuing to increase consumer awareness through brand and product marketing, the introduction of new Connected Fitness Products in existing and new fitness and wellness verticals, and geographical expansion. In addition to our Connected Fitness Subscription for $39.00 per month, we also offer a Digital Subscription for $19.49 per month. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 102,000 Digital Subscribers. In 2018, we relaunched Peloton Digital 61 Table of Contents when we expanded our content offering to include bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. Later in 2018, we significantly expanded our yoga content offering and launched meditation. While we believe we can grow our Digital Subscriber base over time, the focus of Peloton Digital today is to increase engagement with our Connected Fitness Subscribers. In addition, Peloton Digital provides users an opportunity to try Peloton content before they purchase a Connected Fitness Product. Increase Engagement to Drive High Retention By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their personal goals. We continuously improve our platform, which results in increased usage of our Connected Fitness Products and Peloton Digital. We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us develop new software features that improve our Member experience, as well as create new on-trend fitness and wellness content. We also develop innovative fitness programs and goal-based challenges to help Members feel more accountable and motivated. As our community of Members continues to grow, the Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more competitive, more immersive, and more connected, fueling the desire of each of our Members to achieve their fitness goals. Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen an increase in Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber. Total Workouts completed by our Connected Fitness Subscribers have grown significantly over the past few years. We evaluate engagement on a year-over-year basis given the seasonality in our Members\u2019 workout patterns. Our third quarter tends to have elevated workout levels due to New Year\u2019s resolutions and colder weather. Our first quarter tends to have lower workout levels as Members enjoy outdoor-based fitness activities and summer vacations. For a definition of Workouts, Total Workouts, and Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber, see the section titled \u201c\u2014Key Operational and Business Metrics.\u201d We have seen an increase in engagement over time, across our cohorts of Connected Fitness Subscribers. Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber are higher for our most recent cohorts and engagement for each cohort has been consistent or improved over time. For example, the fiscal 2017 cohort includes all Connected Fitness Subscribers who joined Peloton between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. 62 Table of Contents Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our consistently low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn. For a definition of Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, see the section titled \u201c\u2014Key Operational and Business Metrics.\u201d Improve Profitability through Scaling Content Platform The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating leverage. We will be able to leverage a significant portion of our content creation costs given that we only need a limited number of production studios and instructors to support our growth. We measure Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin to understand and evaluate the profitability of our subscription business and Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. For a definition of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin, see the section titled \u201c\u2014Key Operational and Business Metrics.\u201d Our subscription gross margin for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 9.7%, 43.3%, and 42.7%, respectively. The increase in our subscription gross margin from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by content costs for past use, which, while relatively flat on an aggregate dollar basis, more adversely impacted subscription gross margin for fiscal 2017 given a lower Connected Fitness Subscriber base. We also drove further margin improvements in fiscal 2018 by leveraging fixed costs of content production while expanding our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. Subscription gross margin decreased during fiscal 2019 as we began to make significant investments in Tread content as well as expansion into new content verticals. We also began incurring expenses for our new production studios in New York City and London and incurred additional content costs for past use in fiscal 2019. Our Subscription Contribution Margin for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 13.5%, 47.5%, and 50.8%, respectively. When excluding content costs for past use, in fiscal 2019 we experienced a decline in our Subscription Contribution Margin which was driven by additional investments in new content verticals in the quarters ended December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. See the section titled \u201c\u2014Content Costs for Past Use\u201d for additional information. To support the launch of our Tread, we leased a new studio in New York City and added hundreds of original programs including bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. In late 2018, we significantly expanded our 63 Table of Contents yoga offering and launched meditation. We view the majority of these costs as fixed and scalable over time as we grow our Subscriber base. For a discussion of these recent growth initiatives see the section titled \u201c\u2014Factors Affecting Our Performance\u2014Ability to Invest.\u201d We expect to benefit from continued efficiencies in sales and marketing expenses resulting from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth referrals from our growing Member base, and further optimization of our sales and marketing investments by channel. We also expect to achieve operating leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative expenses, including those associated with our new headquarters in New York City. Maintain Compelling Unit Economics Our unit economic model benefits from low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn and high Subscription Contribution Margin. When we acquire a new Connected Fitness Subscriber, we offset sales and marketing investments with the gross profit earned on the sale of Connected Fitness Products, allowing for rapid payback. Thereafter, we earn recurring, high-margin subscription revenue. To illustrate our compelling unit economic model, we have presented our Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value and Net Customer Acquisition costs for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019. We have a high Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, which can be calculated as: [TABLE_234] \u2022 our monthly Connected Fitness Subscription fee of $39.00; multiplied by [TABLE_235] \u2022 Connected Fitness Subscribers added in a period; multiplied by [TABLE_236] \u2022 months of Subscription Lifetime implied by our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn in the period (calculated by dividing one by our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn); multiplied by [TABLE_237] \u2022 (Subscription Contribution plus content costs for past use) divided by subscription revenue. Our Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, was $267.1 million, $604.4 million, and $1,053.8 million, respectively, or $3,433, $4,015, and $3,593 per Connected Fitness Subscriber, respectively. As we expand our content offering, develop new interactive software features, and grow our community of Members, we believe we can maintain a low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, resulting in a high Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. In addition, with the growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base over time, we expect to improve our Subscription Contribution Margin as we scale our fixed content production costs. Net Customer Acquisition Cost (profit) can be calculated as Adjusted Sales and Marketing Expense (which excludes depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense) less Adjusted Connected Fitness Product Gross Profit (which excludes depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense). Our Net Customer Acquisition Costs (profit) for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, and fiscal 2019, was $14.2 million, $(4.9) million, and $1.6 million, respectively, or $183, $(33), and $5 per Connected Fitness Subscriber added, respectively. We believe we will continue to drive rapid payback and efficiencies in Net Customer Acquisition Costs (profit) by further leveraging sales and marketing investments as a result of heightened brand awareness and growing word-of-mouth referrals. Changes in Connected Fitness Product margins or sales and marketing expenses may result in an inability to fully offset our customer acquisition costs. Factors Affecting Our Performance Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the following: Ability to Attract New Connected Fitness Subscribers and Scale Our Platform Our long-term growth will depend in part on our continued ability to attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers. We are still in the early stages of growth in our existing markets and believe we can significantly grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. If we cannot attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers as quickly as we expect, our operating results may be adversely affected. The inability to grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber base would reduce efficiency in customer acquisition costs and slow operating margin improvement. 64 Table of Contents To increase affordability and expand our addressable market, we offer attractive financing programs for qualified customers. We report revenue net of third-party financing partner fees. Accordingly, to the extent that these third-party financing partner fees change, or the number of products purchased through our financing programs fluctuates, our revenue and Subscription Contribution Margin will be affected. Ability to Engage and Retain Our Existing Connected Fitness Subscribers Our long-term growth will partially depend on our continued ability to retain existing Connected Fitness Subscribers. Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers, and we must continue to provide an experience that our Members love. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in engaging and retaining Connected Fitness Subscribers, or that retention levels will not materially decline due to any number of factors, such as harm to our brand, or our inability to anticipate and meet consumer preferences and successfully implement new software features and content to meet those demands. Ability to Invest We will continue to make investments across our business to drive growth, and therefore we expect expenses to increase. We will continue to invest significant resources in sales and marketing to drive demand for our products and services. We will also continue to invest in research and development to enhance our platform, develop new Connected Fitness Products and software features, update and expand our content offering, and improve our infrastructure. For example, during fiscal 2019, we added eight new instructors and opened a temporary New York City production studio to produce bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. To support our rapid growth, we also intend to continue investing in our supply chain and logistics operations. We have in the past made, and may also in the future make, acquisitions or investments in strategic partnerships to further drive our growth. As cost of revenue, operating expenses, and capital expenditures increase as we invest in our business for long-term growth, we are likely to experience additional losses, delaying our ability to achieve profitability and adversely affecting cash flows. Ability to Grow in New Geographies Entering new geographic markets requires us to invest in sales and marketing, infrastructure, and personnel, including by establishing additional offices, showrooms, and potentially smaller local production studios. Our international growth will depend on our ability to sell Connected Fitness Products and associated Connected Fitness Subscriptions in international markets. Our international expansion has resulted in, and will continue to result in, increased costs and is subject to a variety of risks, including local competition, content localization, multilingual customer support, potentially complex delivery logistics, and compliance with foreign laws and regulations. Seasonality Historically, we have experienced higher revenue in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year compared to other quarters, due in large part to seasonal holiday demand, New Year\u2019s resolutions, and cold weather. For example, in fiscal 2018 and 2019, our second and third quarters combined each represented 63% and 63% of our total revenue. We also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods, which we expect to continue. 65 Table of Contents Key Operational and Business Metrics In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key operational and business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions. [TABLE_238] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 Connected Fitness Subscribers 107,708 245,667 511,202 Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn 0.70 % 0.64 % 0.65 % Total Workouts (in thousands) 6,157 17,856 52,151 Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber 7.5 8.4 11.5 Subscription Gross Profit (in millions) $ 3.2 $ 34.7 $ 77.4 Subscription Contribution (in millions) (1) $ 4.4 $ 38.0 $ 91.9 Subscription Gross Margin 9.7 % 43.3 % 42.7 % Subscription Contribution Margin (1) 13.5 % 47.5 % 50.8 % Net Loss (in millions) $ (71.1 ) $ (47.9 ) $ (195.6 ) Adjusted EBITDA (in millions) (2) $ (51.8 ) $ (30.4 ) $ (71.3 ) Adjusted EBITDA Margin (2) (23.7 )% (7.0 )% (7.8 )% [TABLE_239] (1) Please see the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of gross profit to Subscription Contribution and an explanation for why we consider Subscription Contribution to be a helpful metric for investors. [TABLE_240] (2) Please see the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and an explanation for why we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a helpful metric for investors. Connected Fitness Subscribers Our ability to expand the number of Connected Fitness Subscribers is an indicator of our market penetration and growth. A Connected Fitness Subscriber can represent a person, household or commercial property, such as a hotel or residential building. A Connected Fitness Subscription is either a paid Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers) or paused Connected Fitness Subscriber (a Connected Fitness Subscription where the Subscriber has requested to \u201cPause\u201d for up to 3 months). We do not include canceled or unpaid Connected Fitness Subscriptions in the Connected Fitness Subscriber count. Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn We use Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn to measure the retention of our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We define Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn as Connected Fitness Subscriber cancellations, net of reactivations, in the quarter, divided by the average number of beginning Connected Fitness Subscribers in each month, divided by three months. This metric does not include data related to our Digital Subscribers. Total Workouts and Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber We review Total Workouts and Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber to measure engagement, which is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We define Total Workouts as all workouts completed during a given period. We define a Workout as a Connected Fitness Subscriber either completing at least 50% of an instructor-led or scenic ride or run or ten or more minutes of \u201cJust Ride\u201d or \u201cJust Run\u201d mode. We define Average Monthly Workouts per Connected Fitness Subscriber as the Total Workouts completed in the quarter divided by the average number of Connected Fitness Subscribers in each month, divided by three months. Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin We use Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin to measure our ability to scale and leverage the costs of our Connected Fitness Subscriptions and measure Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will allow us to improve our Subscription Contribution Margin and 66 Table of Contents aggregate Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. While there are variable costs, including music royalties, associated with our Connected Fitness Subscriptions, a significant portion of our content creation costs are fixed given that we operate with a limited number of production studios and instructors. The fixed nature of those expenses should scale over time as we grow our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. We define Subscription Contribution as subscription revenue less cost of subscription revenue, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization expense, and stock-based compensation expense. Subscription Contribution Margin is calculated by dividing Subscription Contribution by subscription revenue. See the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u2014Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin\u201d for information regarding our use of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin and a reconciliation of Subscription Contribution to subscription gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. We also believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. We expect Adjusted EBITDA Margin to increase over the long-term as we continue to scale our business and achieve greater leverage in our operating expenses. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude other (expense) income, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, transaction costs, certain litigation expenses, consisting of legal settlements and related fees for specific proceedings that arise outside of the ordinary course of our business, and non-cash ground lease expense related to build-to-suit obligations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. See the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u2014Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\u201d for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss. Components of our Operating Results We operate and manage our business in three reportable segments: Connected Fitness Products, Subscription, and Other. We identify our reportable segments based on the information used by management to monitor performance and make operating decisions. See Note 17 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for additional information regarding our reportable segments. Revenue Connected Fitness Products Connected Fitness Product revenue consists of sales of our Bike and Tread and related accessories, associated fees for delivery and installation, and extended warranty agreements. Connected Fitness Product revenue is recognized at the time of delivery and is recorded net of returns and discounts and third-party financing program fees. Subscription Subscription revenue consists of revenue generated from our monthly $39.00 Connected Fitness Subscription and $19.49 Digital Subscription. Subscription revenue also includes revenue generated from guests who pay to take a live class in one of our studios, which has been immaterial to date. Historically, we offered a prepaid subscription option where Members earned one free month or three free months of subscription with the upfront purchase of a 12-month subscription or 24-month subscription, respectively. We also offered Connected Fitness Subscribers the ability to purchase a 12-, 24-, or 39-month prepaid subscription with the purchase of a Connected Fitness Product as part of our financing program, which provides 0% APR financing to qualified customers over a term of up to 39 months. The associated financing fees are paid to our third-party partner at the outset of the arrangement and are recorded as a reduction to Subscription revenue over the contract term. We terminated both offerings by July 2018 at which point all subsequent future subscriptions became month-to-month; however, we will continue to see an impact to subscription revenue until fiscal 2022 as the revenue under legacy prepaid subscriptions is earned ratably over the remaining service period, which extends up to 39 months from the initial date of subscription activation. 67 Table of Contents Other Other revenue primarily consists of Peloton branded apparel. Cost of Revenue Connected Fitness Products Connected Fitness Product cost of revenue consists of Bike and Tread product costs, including manufacturing costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics. As we launch new Connected Fitness Products, such as the Tread, and continue to grow our presence in new regions where we have not yet achieved economies of scale, we expect to incur higher cost of revenue (as a percentage of sales) for our Connected Fitness Products. Subscription Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content creation and costs to stream content to our Members. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including studio rent and occupancy, other studio overhead, instructor and production personnel-related expenses, as well as variable costs, including music royalty fees, content costs for past use, third-party platform streaming costs and payment processing fees for our monthly subscription billings. While our fixed costs currently represent the majority of these costs, music royalty fees are our largest subscription variable cost. As we have grown the number of licensing agreements with music rights holders, music royalty fees as a percent of our subscription revenue has increased. However, unlike music streaming services where having an exhaustive music catalog is vital to be able to compete for customers, we have control over what music we select for our classes. As a result, we expect to be able to manage music expense such that, over time, these fees as a percentage of subscription revenue will flatten, or even decrease. Other Other cost of revenue consists primarily of apparel costs, as well as related warehousing and fulfillment costs. Operating Expenses Research and Development Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel and facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and software platform expenses. We capitalize certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software which may also cause research and development expenses to vary from period to period. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to hire personnel to develop new and enhance existing Connected Fitness Products and interactive software. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense consists of performance marketing media spend, asset creation, and other brand creative, all showroom expenses and related lease payments, payment processing fees incurred in connection with the sale of our Connected Fitness Products, sales and marketing personnel-related expenses, and all expenses related to Peloton Digital. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing capabilities in the future and expect this expense to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we release new products and expand internationally. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on total revenue and the timing of our investments in our sales and marketing functions as these investments may vary in scope and scale over future periods. General and Administrative General and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses and facilities-related costs primarily for our executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, and IT functions. General and administrative expense also includes fees for professional services principally comprised of legal, audit, tax and accounting services, and insurance. Following the completion of this offering, we expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance and reporting obligations of public companies, 68 Table of Contents and increased costs for insurance, investor relations expenses, and professional services. As a result, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, but we expect to leverage these expenses over time as we grow our revenue and Connected Fitness Subscriber base. Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income, net consists of interest (expense) income associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt issuance costs and interest income earned on investments. Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized. Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation Expense Tender Offers In April 2017, we commenced a cash tender offer, which was completed in June 2017, for the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock from existing stockholders, including current and former employees, which had a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2017. In the 2017 tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of 9,661,156 shares of our capital stock. The purchase price per share in the tender offer was in excess of the fair value of our outstanding common stock at the time of the transaction and accordingly, upon the completion of the transaction, we recorded $8.3 million as stock-based compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per share of common stock paid to our employees over the fair value of the tendered shares. In August 2018, we commenced a cash tender offer, which was completed in October 2018, for the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock from existing stockholders, including current and former employees, which had a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2019. In the 2018 tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of 9,264,518 shares of our capital stock. The purchase price per share in the tender offer was in excess of the fair value of our outstanding common stock at the time of the transaction and accordingly, upon the completion of the transaction, we recorded $28.2 million as stock-based compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per share of common stock paid to our employees over the fair value of the tendered shares. Additionally, for shares held less than six months and thus deemed to not be subject to market risks, we recorded a liability for the maximum number of shares that were eligible for the tender offer when it became probable that the event allowing for the redemption would occur. To the extent that this liability exceeded amounts previously recognized in equity, the excess was recognized as compensation cost. As a result of this liability, we recognized an additional stock-compensation expense of $33.5 million. See Note 12 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for additional information. 69 Table of Contents The total stock-based compensation expense related to the tender offers impacted fiscal 2017 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019 as follows: [TABLE_241] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 Three Months Ended Sept. 30, 2018 Dec. 31, 2018 (unaudited) (in millions) Cost of revenue: Connected Fitness Products $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 Subscription \u2014 0.9 0.2 Other \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Total cost of revenue \u2014 0.9 0.2 Research and development \u2014 2.5 1.3 Sales and marketing \u2014 3.9 2.3 General and administrative 8.3 26.2 24.4 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 8.3 $ 33.5 $ 28.2 Results of Operations The following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented.

We refer to these payments as content costs for past use. 71 Table of Contents Comparison of the Years Ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019 Revenue [TABLE_249] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 to 2018 % Change 2018 to 2019 % Change 2017 2018 2019 (dollars in millions) Revenue: Connected Fitness Products $ 183.5 $ 348.6 $ 719.2 89.9 % 106.3% Subscription 32.5 80.3 181.1 147.3 125.6 Other 2.6 6.2 14.7 135.5 137.9 Total revenue $ 218.6 $ 435.0 $ 915.0 99.0 110.3 Percentage of total revenue: Connected Fitness Products 84.0 % 80.1 % 78.6 % Subscription 14.8 18.5 19.8 Other 1.2 1.4 1.6 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 2018 Compared to 2019 Connected Fitness Products revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $370.7 million, or 106.3%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the significant growth in the number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period. Subscription revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $100.8 million, or 125.6%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth in our Connected Fitness Subscribers from 245,667 to 511,202 during the period. The growth of our Connected Fitness Subscribers was primarily driven by the increased number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period and our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.65% for fiscal 2019. Other revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $8.5 million, or 137.9%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales during the period. 2017 Compared to 2018 Connected Fitness Products revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $165.0 million, or 89.9%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the significant growth in the number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period. Subscription revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $47.8 million, or 147.3%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth in our Connected Fitness Subscribers from 107,708 to 245,667 during the period. The growth of our Connected Fitness Subscribers was primarily driven by the increased number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period and our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.64% in fiscal 2018. Other revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $3.6 million, or 135.5%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales during the period. 72 Table of Contents Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin [TABLE_250] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 to 2018 2018 to 2019 2017 2018 2019 % Change % Change (dollars in millions) Cost of Revenue: Connected Fitness Products $ 113.5 $ 195.0 $ 410.8 71.7 % 110.7 % Subscription 29.3 45.5 103.7 55.4 127.7 Other 1.9 4.9 17.0 163.3 247.7 Total cost of revenue $ 144.7 $ 245.4 $ 531.4 69.6 116.6 Gross Profit: Connected Fitness Products $ 70.0 $ 153.6 $ 308.4 119.4 % 100.8 % Subscription 3.2 34.7 77.4 NM 122.9 Other 0.8 1.3 (2.3 ) 68.6 NM Total gross profit $ 73.9 $ 189.6 $ 383.6 156.5 102.3 Gross Margin: Connected Fitness Products 38.1 % 44.1 % 42.9 % Subscription 9.7 43.3 42.7 Other 29.3 21.0 (15.5 ) * NM\u2014Not meaningful 2018 Compared to 2019 Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $215.8 million, or 110.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily driven by costs associated with the growth in the number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period. Our Connected Fitness Products gross margin decreased slightly due to the increasing mix of deliveries of Tread, partially offset by cost efficiencies achieved in the manufacturing of our Bike. Subscription cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $58.2 million, or 127.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $23.1 million in music royalty and streaming delivery fees driven by increased usage of our platform, an increase of $14.0 million in personnel-related expenses due to our introduction of the Tread and other new fitness and wellness verticals such as yoga and meditation, and expansion into the United Kingdom, an increase of $8.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense driven by our acquired developed technology, and an increase of $4.6 million in occupancy costs associated with lease commencement for our two new production studios in New York City and London. Subscription gross margin decreased by 53 basis points from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 as we invested in new initiatives discussed above, partially offset by leveraging the fixed costs of content production as we scaled our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. Included in subscription cost of revenue are content costs for past use of $14.5 million and $16.4 million for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. These costs had a negative basis point impact on subscription gross margin of 1,805 and 908 for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. Other cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $12.1 million, or 247.7%, compared to fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales during the period as well as an increase in our apparel inventory reserves. 73 Table of Contents Other gross margin decreased during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to an increase in our apparel inventory reserves. 2017 Compared to 2018 Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $81.5 million, or 71.7%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the growth in the number of Connected Fitness Products delivered during the period. We gained significant efficiencies in manufacturing costs resulting in a 592 basis point improvement in Connected Fitness Product gross margin from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Subscription cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $16.2 million, or 55.4%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily driven by a $10.9 million increase in music royalty and streaming delivery fees, a $2.7 million increase in personnel-related expenses as we continued to grow our content offering for the Tread, and a $1.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. We also incurred an additional $1.3 million in production studio occupancy costs primarily attributable to the opening of a second production studio in June 2017 to support Tread content creation. Subscription gross margin significantly improved by 3,356 basis points from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. This was primarily driven by the impact of content costs for past use of $15.5 million and $14.5 million for fiscal 2017 and 2018, respectively, which more adversely impacted gross margin for fiscal 2017 given the lower Connected Fitness Subscriber base. These content costs for past use had a negative basis point impact on subscription gross margin of 4,788 and 1,805 for fiscal 2017 and 2018, respectively. We drove further margin improvements by leveraging fixed costs of content production while scaling our Connected Fitness Subscriber base in fiscal 2018. Other cost of revenue for fiscal 2018 increased $3.0 million, or 163.3%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our branded apparel sales.

This increase was due primarily to an increase in personnel-related expenses, which, excluding stock-based compensation expense, increased $16.8 million, due to increased headcount. Stock-based compensation expense increased $6.3 million, of which $3.8 million was related to incremental costs associated with the tender offer completed in October 2018. 2017 Compared to 2018 Research and development expenses for fiscal 2018 increased $10.3 million, or 79.1%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was due primarily to increases of $3.9 million in product development and research costs, $3.3 million in personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense, resulting from increased headcount, and $1.1 million in web hosting fees to create new, as well as improve existing products and interactive software features on our platform. 74 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing [TABLE_252] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 to 2018 % Change 2018 to 2019 % Change 2017 2018 2019 (dollars in millions) Sales and marketing $ 86.0 $ 151.4 $ 324.0 76.0 % 114.1% As a percentage of total revenue 39.3 % 34.8 % 35.4 % 2018 Compared to 2019 Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2019 increased $172.6 million, or 114.1%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was due primarily to increased spending of $117.4 million on advertising and marketing programs. In addition, personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense, increased by $22.2 million due to increased headcount, expenses related to our showrooms and microstores increased by $15.3 million due to our addition of 39 global retail locations, and stock-based compensation expense increased $7.7 million, of which $6.2 million was related to incremental costs associated with the tender offer completed in October 2018. 2017 Compared to 2018 Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2018 increased $65.4 million, or 76.0%, compared to fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily driven by $44.3 million in increased marketing costs, $8.2 million of increased personnel-related expenses, $5.4 million of increased payment processing fees, and $5.2 million of additional costs related to 12 additional retail locations we added in the period.

The increase was due primarily to an increase of $64.1 million in stock-based compensation expense, of which $50.6 million related to the tender offer completed in October 2018. Professional fees, comprised of legal, accounting, and consulting fees, increased by $24.4 million. In addition, personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense, increased by $22.7 million due to increased headcount. We also incurred an additional $8.4 million expense relating to new system implementations and software licenses to support our growth and scale our operations, and facilities costs increased $12.9 million, of which $7.2 million was lease expense related to build-to-suit obligations. 2017 Compared to 2018 General and administrative expense for fiscal 2018 increased $16.8 million, or 36.8%, compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to an additional $6.5 million in professional services fees, $6.4 million in personnel-related expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense, due to increased headcount, $2.5 million in new system implementations and licenses to support our growth and scale our operations, and $2.3 million of facilities costs from additional leased office space. These costs were partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expense due to an incremental $8.3 million charge incurred in fiscal 2017 related to the tender offer completed in June 2017. 75 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net and Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes [TABLE_254] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 to 2018 % Change 2018 to 2019 % Change 2017 2018 2019 (dollars in millions) Other (expense) income, net $ (0.3 ) $ (0.3 ) $ 6.7 22.8 % NM Provision for income taxes \u2014 0.1 0.1 NM NM *NM\u2014not meaningful Other (expense) income, net, was $6.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $(0.3) million for fiscal 2018.

Subscription revenue increased in each of the quarters presented primarily due to Connected Fitness Subscriber growth and low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn. Cost of Revenue Connected Fitness Products cost of revenue has fluctuated in line with Connected Fitness Products revenue for all periods presented due primarily to costs associated with sales of Connected Fitness Products. Our subscription cost of revenue generally increased each quarter as a result of increases in music royalties, streaming, and platform costs, as well as payment processing fees. We saw fluctuations in the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due to content costs for past use. Operating Expenses Research and development expense increased for all periods presented, primarily due to personnel-related expenses as we have continued to increase our headcount to support product and platform innovation. 78 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expense increased in the second and third quarter of each fiscal year due to an increase in expenses associated with advertising costs and other marketing programs for the holiday season. In addition, sales and marketing expenses increased as a result of higher personnel-related expenses and occupancy costs as we increased headcount and number of showrooms to support our growth. General and administrative expense generally increased for all periods presented, primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses, facilities costs, and professional service fees as we grow our business and scale operations. We saw a significant increase in general and administrative expenses in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2019 related to stock-based compensation expense associated with the tender offer completed in October 2018. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Set forth below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the periods presented: [TABLE_257] Three Months Ended Sep. 30, 2017 Dec. 31, 2017 Mar. 31, 2018 Jun. 30, 2018 Sep. 30, 2018 Dec. 31, 2018 Mar. 31, 2019 Jun. 30, 2019 (unaudited) (dollars in millions) Net loss $ (17.0 ) $ (4.4 ) $ (15.6 ) $ (10.9 ) $ (54.5 ) $ (55.1 ) $ (38.6 ) $ (47.4 ) Adjusted to exclude the following: Other (expense) income, net \u2014 (0.3 ) (0.2 ) 0.1 1.0 0.9 3.0 1.8 Provision for income taxes \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.1 \u2014 \u2014 0.2 (0.1 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 1.1 1.4 1.5 2.6 4.2 5.0 5.8 6.7 Stock-based compensation expense 2.0 1.8 1.7 3.0 36.7 31.8 7.5 13.5 Transaction costs \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.5 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.4 Litigation expenses 0.2 0.1 0.6 0.7 1.2 2.8 5.8 2.3 Ground lease expense related to build-to-suit obligations \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1.7 2.6 2.9 Adjusted EBITDA $ (13.6 ) $ 0.8 $ (11.6 ) $ (4.2 ) $ (13.5 ) $ (14.6 ) $ (19.7 ) $ (23.6 ) Adjusted EBITDA margin (24.2 )% 0.6 % (8.2 )% (4.0 )% (12.0 )% (5.6 )% (6.2 )% (10.6 )% Starting in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we began to incur significant costs related to certain growth initiatives including the introduction of our Tread, international expansion, and content investments which had an adverse impact on our Adjusted EBITDA. To support our growth, we have also begun to make investments in supply chain, product development, and a new headquarters in New York City which we expect will continue to impact our Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA was also more adversely impacted in certain quarters presented due to the variable nature of our content costs for past use.

See the section titled \u201c\u2014Content Costs for Past Use.\u201d Excluding content costs for past use, Subscription Contribution increased in each of the quarters presented primarily due to the growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base and our continued low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn. Excluding content costs for past use, Subscription Contribution Margin increased quarterly through September 30, 2018 as we continued to leverage our fixed content costs across our growing Connected Fitness Subscriber base. In the subsequent quarters we began to make significant investments in Tread content, including the leasing of a Tread studio, as well as expansion into new content verticals such as yoga and meditation. Starting in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, our Subscription Contribution costs also include rent expense for our new production studio in New York City, which caused our Subscription Contribution Margin to decline. Starting in the quarter ended March 31, 2019, our Subscription Contribution costs also include rent expense for our new London studio. In the quarter ended June 30, 2019, Subscription Contribution Margin increased and we expect to continue to leverage the largely fixed costs of our studio production as we scale our Connected Fitness Subscriber base. Content Costs for Past Use Included within Adjusted EBITDA and Subscription Contribution are content costs for past use as follows: [TABLE_259] Three Months Ended Sep. 30, 2017 Dec. 31, 2017 Mar. 31, 2018 Jun. 30, 2018 Sep. 30, 2018 Dec. 31, 2018 Mar. 31, 2019 Jun. 30, 2019 (unaudited) (in millions) Content costs for past use $ 3.5 $ 1.9 $ 6.5 $ 2.6 $ 2.9 $ 2.3 $ 11.3 $ \u2014 From time-to-time, we execute music royalty agreements with various music rights holders. As part of these go-forward license agreements, we may also enter into agreements whereby we are released from all potential licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted material in our content in exchange for a mutually-agreed payment. We refer to these payments as content costs for past use. These costs can vary considerably from quarter to quarter since they represent our estimates of potential future release payments based upon license agreements previously entered into and the market share and size of the music rights holder. These estimates are subject to a variety of complex and evolving legal issues across many jurisdictions and are not predictable, which can result in fluctuation over time. 80 Table of Contents To date, we have entered into numerous agreements with major record labels and major publishers, independent labels and publishers, and major performing rights organizations to resolve instances of alleged past use while entering into go-forward license agreements with each of these parties. We have also improved upon a music content management and reporting system that allows our instructors to create class playlists from a selection of songs licensed to us. Based on these efforts, we believe that payments for content costs for past use will decrease over time and eventually be eliminated.

As of June 30, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $162.1 million and marketable securities of $216.0 million. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flow from operations, marketable securities portfolio, and amounts available for borrowing under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other growth initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new Connected Fitness Product introductions, market acceptance of our Connected Fitness Products, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement In June 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner and Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and Silicon Valley Bank, as joint syndication agents, which amended and restated the loan and security agreement we previously entered into in November 2017. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million secured revolving credit facility, including up to the lesser of $150.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the facility for the issuance of letters of credit. Interest on the Credit Agreement is paid based on LIBOR plus 2.75% or an Alternative Base Rate plus 1.75%. We are required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375% on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The principal amount, if any, is payable in full in June 2024. As of June 30, 2019, we had not drawn on the credit facility and did not have outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We have the option to repay our borrowings under the Credit Agreement without premium or penalty prior to maturity. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing base certificates, as well as customary covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The Credit Agreement also contains certain financial condition covenants, including maintaining a total level of liquidity of not less than $125.0 million and 81 Table of Contents maintaining certain minimum total revenue ranging from $725 million to $1,985 million depending on the applicable date of determination. As of June 30, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $40.1 million issued primarily to cover security deposits for our operating lease and inventory purchase obligations. Cash Flows [TABLE_261] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (in millions) Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities $ (18.6 ) $ 49.7 $ (108.6 ) Net cash flows used in investing activities (10.2 ) (56.7 ) (297.5 ) Net cash flow from financing activities 143.6 3.1 417.2 Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities of $(108.6) million for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a net loss of $195.6 million and a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $22.9 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $109.8 million. The decrease in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an $111.3 million increase in inventory levels as a result of our introduction of the Peloton Tread, as well as our expansion into the United Kingdom and Canada, and a $30.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets driven by general growth; partially offset by an $117.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to increased expenditures to support general business growth. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense of $89.5 million of which $61.7 million related to a tender offer completed in October 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities of $49.7 million for fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $81.5 million and non-cash adjustments of $16.1 million, partially offset by a net loss of $47.9 million. The increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $63.0 million increase in deferred revenue associated with our prior Subscription offering launched in October 2017 whereby customers could purchase a subscription upfront for a 39-month term as well as overall growth in our sales of Connected Fitness Products, and a $41.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth; partially offset by a $9.6 million increase in inventory levels and a $12.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets driven by general growth. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Net cash used in operating activities of $18.6 million for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a net loss of $71.1 million, partially offset by an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $38.2 million and non-cash adjustments of $14.3 million. The increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $22.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to growth of expenditures to support general business growth, and a $19.0 million increase in deferred revenue associated with overall growth in our sales of Connected Fitness Products. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2019 of $297.5 million was primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities of $249.8 million and capital expenditures of $83.0 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $36.0 million. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 of $56.7 million was due to the cash portion of the acquisition of Neurotic Media of $28.7 million, net of cash acquired, and cash used of $28.0 million for capital expenditures. We acquired Neurotic Media primarily to automate and streamline content rights management and to enhance Member engagement through new music features. Of the total purchase consideration, $4.2 million has been recorded to goodwill, $24.8 million to acquired developed technology, and $0.1 million in tangible net assets. Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 of $10.2 million for capital expenditures. 82 Table of Contents Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities of $417.2 million for fiscal 2019 was primarily related to net proceeds from issuance of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock of $408.8 million, net of issuance costs and repurchases of common stock and preferred stock, as well as $9.3 million in proceeds from exercises of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities of $3.1 million for fiscal 2018 was primarily related to proceeds from exercises of stock options of $7.4 million, partially offset by $4.3 million in debt repayment and issuance costs. Net cash provided by financing activities of $143.6 million for fiscal 2017 was primarily related to net proceeds from issuance of Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock of $145.6 million, net of issuance costs and repurchases of common stock and preferred stock, as well as proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility of $10.5 million. These amounts were partially offset by the $13.0 million debt repayment of our term loan and revolver. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of June 30, 2019: [TABLE_262] Payments Due By Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in millions) Operating lease obligations (1) $ 784.9 $ 33.0 $ 99.1 $ 107.4 $ 545.4 Minimum guarantees (2) 42.0 13.3 28.7 \u2014 \u2014 Unused credit fee payments (3) 3.9 0.8 1.6 1.6 \u2014 Total $ 830.8 $ 47.0 $ 129.4 $ 109.0 $ 545.4 [TABLE_263] (1) Operating lease obligations relate to our office space, warehouses, production studios, and retail showrooms and microstores. The lease terms are between one and twenty-one years, and the majority of the lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period. [TABLE_264] (2) We are subject to minimum royalty payments associated with our license agreements for the use of licensed content. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014We are party to many music license agreements that are complex and impose numerous obligations upon us that may make it difficult to operate our business, and a breach of such agreements could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\u201d [TABLE_265] (3) We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2019, we were contingently liable for approximately $40.1 million in standby letters of credit as security for our operating lease obligations. The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts. Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the table. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers and manufacturers within short periods of time. We subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products. During the normal course of business, we and our manufacturers procure components based upon a forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, we may be liable to our suppliers and manufacturers for the cost of the unutilized component orders or components purchased by our manufacturers. In December 2017, we entered into a 21-year operating lease agreement for our new fitness programming hub in New York City. This lease commenced in October 2018, upon the date we took possession of the leased space and committed to make $99.5 million in minimum fixed payments over the term of the lease agreement, although cash payments for rental obligations under the lease do not begin until October 2019. This lease contains a renewal option for two additional five-year periods and includes a tenant improvement allowance of $3.0 million. In November 2018, we entered into a 16-year operating lease agreement for space to be used as our new corporate headquarters in New York City. This lease is expected to commence in August 2019 when we take possession of the leased space and commit to pay $503.0 million in minimum fixed payments over the term of the lease. This lease contains a renewal option for an additional 10-year period and includes a tenant improvement allowance of $28.0 million. 83 Table of Contents Between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020, the end of our 2020 fiscal year, we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $250.0 million to $300.0 million, which will be largely attributable to the build out of our new headquarters in New York City, our investment in developing our New York and London production studios, and an increase in the number of showrooms that we operate. In June 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire a third party for approximately $50.0 million. The agreement is subject to standard closing conditions and third-party approvals. We expect to close the transaction in September 2019. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2019. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our Credit Agreement. We monitor our cost of borrowing under our facility, taking into account our funding requirements, and our expectations for short-term rates in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate on our Credit Agreement for all periods presented would not have a material impact on our financial statements. Foreign Currency Risk To date, all of our inventory purchases have been denominated in U.S. dollars. Our international sales are primarily denominated in foreign currencies and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the currencies in which we conduct sales in foreign countries could have an adverse impact on our revenue. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor and supply costs, in other currencies. While we are not currently contractually obligated to pay increased costs due to changes in exchange rates, to the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margins. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from operating expenses is relatively small at this time as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total expenses. To date, we have not entered into derivatives or hedging transactions, as our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has historically been partially hedged as our foreign currency denominated inflows have covered our foreign currency denominated expenses. However, we may enter into derivative or hedging transactions in the future if our exposure to foreign currency should become more significant. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders\u2019 equity/deficit, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions. The critical accounting policies that reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include those noted below. Revenue Recognition Our primary source of revenues are from sales of our Connected Fitness Products including our Bike and Tread, related accessories, and monthly Connected Fitness Subscriptions. 84 Table of Contents We determine revenue recognition through the following steps in accordance with Topic 606 which we adopted as of July 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis: [TABLE_266] \u2022 identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; [TABLE_267] \u2022 identification of the performance obligations in the contract; [TABLE_268] \u2022 determination of the transaction price; [TABLE_269] \u2022 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and [TABLE_270] \u2022 recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Our revenue is reported net of sales returns and discounts, which to date have not been material to our financial statements. We estimate our liability for product returns based on historical return trends by product category and seasonality and an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, and record the expected customer refund liability as a reduction to revenue, and the expected inventory right of recovery as a reduction of cost of revenue. If actual return costs differ from previous estimates, the amount of the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted in the period in which such costs occur. Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For customer contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we account for individual performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling price based on the prices charged to customers. Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received for our performance obligation to transfer or stand ready to transfer, goods or services in the future. Deferred revenue consists of Subscription fees billed that have not been recognized. Customer deposits represent payments received in advance in instances where the revenue contract is cancelable in nature, and therefore, we do not have an unconditional obligation to transfer control to a customer. Product Warranty We offer a standard product warranty that our products will operate under normal, non-commercial use for a period of one-year from the date of original delivery. We have the obligation, at our option, to either repair or replace a defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenue. The estimate of future warranty costs is based on historical as well as current product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures, and warranty policies. We regularly review these estimates to assess the appropriateness of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Should actual product failures, use of materials or other costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty liabilities could be incurred, which could materially affect our results of operations. The estimates and assumptions used to reserve for product warranty have been accurate in all material respects and have not materially changed historically. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interest recognized, if any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired developed technology. At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which was determined based on management\u2019s estimate of the period over which the asset will contribute to our future cash flows. We review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In conducting our annual goodwill impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of the asset, analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows to quantify the amount of impairment, if any. We perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. We assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changing circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 85 Table of Contents Music Royalty Fees We recognize music royalty fees on all music we stream to Members as these fees are incurred in accordance with the terms of the relevant license agreement with the music rights holder. The incurrence of the royalties is primarily driven by content usage by our Members on a fee-per-play basis through the use of our Subscriptions and classified within subscription cost of revenue within the our statement of operations. Our license agreements with music rights holders generally include provisions for advance royalties as well as minimum guarantees. When a minimum guarantee is paid in advance, the guarantee is recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized to subscription cost of revenue. As we execute music license agreements with various music rights holders for go-forward usage, we may also simultaneously enter into a settlement agreement whereby we are released from all potential licensor claims regarding our alleged past use of copyrighted material in exchange for a negotiated payment. These are referred to as \u201ccontent costs for past use\u201d and are recorded within subscription cost of revenue. We have entered into agreements with music rights holders who represent all the music catalogs that we need to operate our service, however, given the uncertain and opaque nature of music rights ownership, our archived library may continue to include music for which certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license agreement, we estimate and record a charge based upon license agreements previously entered into and the market share and size of the music rights holder. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of actual forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For performance-based stock options issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and expensed over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. We calculate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock option awards issued is affected by a number of variables, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option award, the expected term of the award, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. Generally, our stock option awards permit early exercise. The unvested portion of shares exercised is recorded as a liability on our balance sheet and reclassified to equity as vesting occurs. The estimated grant-date fair value of our equity-based awards issued to service providers was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, based on the following assumptions: [TABLE_271] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 Dividend yield \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Weighted-average expected term (in years) 6.3 6.3 6.3 Weighted-average risk-free interest rate 1.4% 2.4% 2.5% Weighted-average expected volatility 79.3% 55.2% 45.0% Dividend Yield. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never declared or paid cash dividends and have no current plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock options, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award\u2019s weighted-average vesting period and its contractual term. For awards granted which contain performance conditions, we estimate the expected term based on the estimated dates that the performance conditions will be satisfied. 86 Table of Contents Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock option\u2019s expected term. Expected Volatility. Since we do not have a trading history of our common stock, the expected volatility was derived from the average historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards, We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our Class A common stock becomes available. We also grant stock-based awards to non-employees. We believe that for stock options issued to non-employees, the fair value of the stock option is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services rendered. Therefore, we estimate the fair value of non-employee stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model with appropriate assumptions. Common Stock Valuations In the absence of a public trading market, the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors, with input from management, taking into account our most recent valuations from an independent third-party valuation specialist. Our board of directors intended all stock options granted to have an exercise price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The assumptions we use in the valuation models were based on future expectations combined with management judgment, and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors: [TABLE_272] \u2022 relevant precedent transactions involving our capital stock; [TABLE_273] \u2022 contemporaneous valuations performed at periodic intervals by unrelated third-party specialists; [TABLE_274] \u2022 the liquidation preferences, rights, preferences, and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to the common stock; [TABLE_275] \u2022 our actual operating and financial performance; [TABLE_276] \u2022 current business conditions and projections; [TABLE_277] \u2022 our stage of development; [TABLE_278] \u2022 the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying the stock options, such as an initial public offering, given prevailing market conditions; [TABLE_279] \u2022 any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability of the common stock underlying the granted options; [TABLE_280] \u2022 recent secondary stock sales and tender offers; [TABLE_281] \u2022 the market performance of comparable publicly-traded companies; and [TABLE_282] \u2022 the U.S. and global capital market conditions. In valuing our common stock at various dates in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, our board of directors determined the equity value of our business using various valuation methods including combinations of income and market approaches with input from management. The income approach estimates the fair value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using an appropriate discount rate to reflect the risks inherent in us achieving these estimated cash flows. The market approach estimates value considering an analysis of guideline public companies. The guideline public companies method estimates value by applying a representative revenue multiple from a peer group of companies in similar lines of business to our forecasted revenue. Our peer group of companies was selected based on operational and economic similarities to us and factors considered included but were not limited to industry, business model, growth rates, customer base, capitalization, size, profitability and stage of development. From time to time, we updated the set of comparable companies as new or more relevant information became available. This approach involves the identification of relevant transactions, and determining relevant multiples to apply to our revenue. The equity values implied by the income and market approaches reasonably approximated each other as of each valuation date. 87 Table of Contents Once we determined an equity value, we used a combination of approaches to allocate the equity value to each class of our stock. We used the option pricing method, or OPM. The OPM allocates values to each equity class by creating a series of call options on our equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preferences, participation rights, and exercise prices of the equity instruments. We also considered an appropriate discount adjustment to recognize the lack of marketability and liquidity due to the fact that stockholders of private companies do not have access to trading markets similar to those enjoyed by stockholders of public companies. The discount for marketability was determined using a protective put option model, in which a put option is used as a proxy for measuring discounts for lack of marketability of securities. Following August 2018, the resulting equity value was then allocated to the common stock using a probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM. Under PWERM, we estimated the value of our common stock based upon an analysis of our values assuming an initial public offering as a possible future event. Additionally, the OPM, using the preferred stockholders\u2019 liquidation preferences, participation rights, dividend rights, and conversion rights to determine the value of each share class in specific potential future outcomes, was considered in the PWERM approach. We also applied a discount for lack of marketability to account for a lack of access to an active public market. In addition, we also considered any private or secondary transactions involving our capital stock as well as tender offers completed in fiscal 2017 and 2019. In our evaluation of those transactions, we considered the facts and circumstances of each transaction to determine the extent to which they represented a fair value exchange. Factors considered include transaction volume, timing, whether the transactions occurred among willing and unrelated parties, and whether the transactions involved investors with access to our financial information. Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock. For valuations after the completion of this offering, our board of directors will determine the fair value of each share of underlying Class A common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant. Future expense amounts for any particular period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or market conditions. Based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding as of June 30, 2019 was $ million, of which $ million related to vested stock options and $ million related to unvested stock options. In addition, we granted options to purchase 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock subsequent to June 30, 2019. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for computing our income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within provision for income taxes. Loss Contingencies We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of 88 Table of Contents damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible but the loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we state that such an estimate cannot be made. We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the dates of the statement of financial position included in this prospectus. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In the course of preparing the financial statements that are included in this prospectus, our management has determined that we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses primarily pertained to IT general controls, controls to address segregation of certain accounting duties, timely reconciliation and analysis of certain key accounts and the review of journal entries. We have concluded that these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting occurred because, prior to this offering, we were a private company and did not have the necessary business processes, systems, personnel and related internal controls necessary to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company. In order to remediate these material weaknesses, we have taken and plan to take the following actions: [TABLE_283] \u2022 implementation of IT general controls to manage access and program changes within our IT environment; [TABLE_284] \u2022 the hiring and continued hiring of additional accounting and finance resources with public company experience; [TABLE_285] \u2022 implementation of additional review controls and processes and requiring timely account reconciliations and analyses; and [TABLE_286] \u2022 implementation of processes and controls to better identify and manage segregation of duties risks. In accordance with the provisions of the JOBS Act, we and our independent registered public accounting firm were not required to, and did not, perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019 nor any period subsequent in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we have identified all, or that we will not in the future have additional, material weaknesses. Material weaknesses may still exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after the completion of this offering. 89 Table of Contents LETTER FROM JOHN FOLEY, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Dear Prospective Investors and Peloton Members, At Peloton, we believe that better is in all of us. It is no secret that exercise makes us feel good. It\u2019s simple science: exercising creates endorphins and endorphins make us happy. On the most basic level, Peloton sells happiness. But of course, we do so much more. Our connected fitness experiences make it easy for our Members to get engaging, social, and highly effective workouts with world-class instructors anytime, anywhere. As a result, our Members work out 80% more than non-Peloton Members. (1) And while the health benefits of regular physical fitness are well documented, the Peloton experience transcends health benefits alone. The happiness our Members experience enables each individual to be a better version of themselves, so they go on to inspire others. And that leads us to Peloton\u2019s mission: to better ourselves, inspire each other, and unite the world through fitness. I founded Peloton in 2012 to solve a challenge in my own life. My wife, Jill, and I knew great fitness experiences made us feel like better versions of ourselves, but there were countless barriers to working out regularly. We loved going to boutique studio fitness classes like cycling, running, boot camp, and yoga. We were addicted to the fast-paced energy, the motivational instructors, the thoughtful programming, and the way exercising with a group pushed us harder. These classes left us feeling energized, refreshed, stronger, and ready to take on anything. However, with demanding jobs and two small children at home, just getting to the gym became harder and harder. Classes with our favorite instructors sold out quickly and were prohibitively expensive. We also had to accommodate someone else\u2019s schedule at someone else\u2019s location. And we were often left without time, without options, and without the feeling of \u201cbeing our better selves\u201d that we sought. I figured that there must be a way to make these workouts more convenient, more affordable, and more accessible. There had to be a way to bring fantastic, high-energy, instructor-led group fitness into the home, to be experienced on my time, any time I wanted. And my hunch was that if I could make it possible, others would want it as well. With that spark of an idea, I looked for brilliant, creative, empathetic, high-integrity partners who shared my ambition and weren\u2019t afraid to tackle complicated business and technology challenges. I was lucky to have several friends who fit the bill in spades: Hisao Kushi, Tom Cortese, Graham Stanton, and Yony Feng. All of my co-founders are still thriving at Peloton, each in a senior role and each an even stronger friend. To create Peloton, we needed to build what we believed to be the best indoor bike on the market, recruit the best instructors in the world, and engineer a state-of-the-art software platform to tie it all together. Against prevailing conventional wisdom, and despite countless investor conference rooms full of very smart skeptics, we were determined for Peloton to build a vertically integrated platform to deliver a seamless end-to-end experience as physically rewarding and addictive as attending a live, in-studio class. In Peloton\u2019s infancy, our lean founding team operated from a one-room \u201cheadquarters\u201d with heavy black curtains that cordoned off a makeshift cycling studio, equipped with a modest six bikes and a used camcorder. We problem-solved our way from streaming live cycling classes to one hundred Members, then to one thousand, and now to over a million Members worldwide. It took a proverbial village to build Peloton, and that once-small village has grown into the community that is now the heart of our brand. From the very beginning, we have always put our Members first in everything we do, and they never cease to amaze us. Through connecting on the Peloton Bike, Tread, and Digital App, our Members have created one of the most supportive, optimistic, diverse, and inclusive communities in the world. Peloton Members are teachers, professional athletes, active military and veterans, healthcare providers, firefighters, policemen, famous actors and musicians, and even former Presidents. They are teenagers and senior citizens. From diverse life experiences, all gender identities and sexual orientations, countless nationalities and ethnicities. We are proud of our community of Members but even prouder of the way that they have united together in support of each other. Every day, I receive personal emails from our Members. The most consistent message I receive: \u201cPeloton has changed my life.\u201d Astonishingly, four out of five Members were not in the market for fitness equipment before they bought the Bike. They were in the market for improving their lives, just as Jill and I were back in 2012 when we started this company and began this journey. [TABLE_287] (1) Source: April 2019 Survey to Members and Non-Members, N=500 90 Table of Contents Seven years later, it is very clear to me that we have an immense opportunity in front of us at Peloton. Peloton is so much more than a Bike \u2014 we believe we have the opportunity to create one of the most innovative global technology platforms of our time. It is an opportunity to create one of the most important and influential interactive media companies in the world; a media company that changes lives, inspires greatness, and unites people. And it is an opportunity to create one of the best places to work in the cities where we operate \u2014 we prioritize culture as much as any other business objective. And to be sure, we are not taking these opportunities lightly. William Lynch, our President; Jill Woodworth, our Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Cornils, our Managing Director of International; my co-founders; and our extended senior leadership team: all of us feel an immense responsibility to deliver on these opportunities, and we are ready. We have worked our entire careers for this very moment. Speaking for the entire Peloton team, we are incredibly grateful for all of our Members from all different backgrounds who love Peloton and have welcomed us into their lives over the past several years. We are truly humbled by your passion for our shared mission. Today, however, we look forward. At this important moment in our journey, I am honored to invite you to join Peloton.

Our ambition is to empower people to improve their lives through fitness. We are a technology company that meshes the physical and digital worlds to create a completely new, immersive, and connected fitness experience.

We are driven by our Members-first obsession and we will be any company we need to be in order to deliver the best fitness experience possible. Who We Are Peloton is the largest interactive fitness platform in the world with a loyal community of over 1.4 million Members. We pioneered connected, technology-enabled fitness, and the streaming of immersive, instructor-led boutique classes to our Members anytime, anywhere. We make fitness entertaining, approachable, effective, and convenient, while fostering social connections that encourage our Members to be the best versions of themselves. We are an innovation company at the nexus of fitness, technology, and media. We have disrupted the fitness industry by developing a first-of-its-kind subscription platform that seamlessly combines the best equipment, proprietary networked software, and world-class streaming digital fitness and wellness content, creating a product that our Members love. Our highly compelling offering helped our Members complete over 58 million Peloton workouts in fiscal 2019. Driven by our Members-first mindset, we built a vertically integrated platform that ensures a best-in-class, end-to-end experience. We have a direct-to-consumer multi-channel sales platform, including 74 showrooms with knowledgeable sales specialists, a high-touch delivery service, and helpful Member support teams. Our Members are as devoted to us as we are to them\u201492% of our Connected Fitness Products ever sold still had an active Connected Fitness Subscription attached as of June 30, 2019. Our Connected Fitness Product offerings currently include the Peloton Bike, launched in 2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Both our Bike and Tread include a state-of-the-art touchscreen that streams live and on-demand classes. Our products have a multitude of interactive software features that encourage frequent use, facilitate healthy competition on our patented leaderboard, build community among our Members, and inspire our Members to track performance and achieve their goals with real-time and historical metrics. As of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products, with approximately 564,000 sold in the United States. Our world-class instructors teach classes across a variety of fitness and wellness disciplines, including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength training, stretching, and meditation. We produce over 950 92 Table of Contents original programs per month and maintain a vast and constantly updated library of thousands of original fitness and wellness programs. We make it easy for Members to find a class that fits their interests based on class type, instructor, music genre, length, available equipment, area of physical focus, and level of difficulty. Our content is available on our Connected Fitness Products through a $39.00 monthly Connected Fitness Subscription, which allows for unlimited workouts across multiple users within a household. Our Connected Fitness Subscribers can enjoy our classes anywhere through Peloton Digital, which is available through iOS and Android mobile devices, as well as most tablets and computers. We also have Digital Subscribers who pay $19.49 per month for access our content library on their own devices. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of our Connected Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. We have experienced significant growth in sales of Connected Fitness Products, which, when combined with our strong Connected Fitness Subscriber retention rates, has driven high growth in Connected Fitness Subscribers. Our Connected Fitness Subscriber base grew by 108% in fiscal 2019. Our compelling financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer acquisition. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, together with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, generates attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. When we acquire new Connected Fitness Subscribers, we are able to offset our customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our Connected Fitness Products. This allows for rapid payback of our sales and marketing investments and results in a robust unit economic model. We are a fast-growing and scaled fitness platform. For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019: [TABLE_288] \u2022 we generated total revenue of $218.6 million, $435.0 million, and $915.0 million, respectively, representing 99.0% and 110.3% year-over-year growth; [TABLE_289] \u2022 we incurred net losses of $(71.1) million, $(47.9) million, and $(195.6) million, respectively; and [TABLE_290] \u2022 our Adjusted EBITDA was $(51.8) million, $(30.4) million, and $(71.3) million, respectively. See the section titled \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u2014Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA. For fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, key metrics of our business included: [TABLE_291] \u2022 Connected Fitness Subscribers of 107,708, 245,667, and 511,202, respectively; and [TABLE_292] \u2022 Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn of 0.70%, 0.64%, and 0.65%, respectively.

According to a 2018 report by the Global Wellness Institute, the total global spend on the wellness industry in 2017 was $4.2 trillion, of which the global spend on fitness and certain categories of wellness, including meditation and yoga, represented nearly $600 billion. According to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, or IHRSA, 183 million and 62 million people had gym memberships globally and in the United States, respectively, as of 2018. Our current product portfolio, which consists of our Bike, Tread, and fitness and wellness subscription services, addresses a large consumer base. Within our current and announced markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany), we estimate that 75 million people used treadmills and 27 million used stationary cycling bikes in the 12 months ended March 2019. In those same regions, we estimate that over 5 million treadmills and nearly 3 million stationary cycling bikes were purchased for in-home use in the 12 months ended March 2019. We believe that we are significantly expanding the market for fitness equipment and products. According to our 2019 Member Survey, four out of five Members were not in the market for home fitness equipment prior to purchasing a Peloton Connected Fitness Product. Opportunity We consider our market opportunity in terms of a Total Addressable Market, or TAM, which we believe is the market we can reach over the long-term in our current and announced markets, and a Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, which we address with our current product verticals and price points. According to our research, our TAM is 67 million households, of which 45 million are in the United States. Within our TAM, we estimate that 52 million households are interested in learning more about our Connected Fitness Products without seeing the price. We estimate that our SAM is 14 million Connected Fitness Products, with 12 million represented in the United States. Historically, our SAM has grown as our brand awareness has increased. With low brand awareness in our current international markets, we believe we will see SAM expand as we make further investments in building brand and product awareness in these regions. We will grow both TAM and SAM as we expand beyond our current geographies and grow SAM as we develop new Connected Fitness Products and content in new fitness verticals. With approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products sold globally as of June 30, 2019, we are approximately 4% penetrated in our SAM of 14 million. For a discussion of the methodology used in determining our TAM and SAM, see the section titled \u201cIndustry and Market Data.\u201d 94 Table of Contents [TABLE_293] * Represents our total addressable market within our current and announced markets\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. Consumer Trends in Our Favor Increasing Focus on Health and Wellness The growing awareness of the benefits of exercise and physical activity is driving increasing participation and spend in fitness and wellness. This has translated into consistent year-over-year growth of the fitness industry both in the United States and globally over the past two decades, even during times of economic recession. According to IHRSA, health club industry revenues in the United States grew at a 5.4% annual growth rate over the last ten years. In addition, employers and health insurance companies are investing in employee well-being by offering incentives for preventative health measures such as exercise. According to a 2017 study by the National Business Group on Health, 74% of employers offer employee wellness incentives, with the average employee incentive amount increasing from $521 in 2013 to $742 in 2017. Streaming Media is the Leading Channel of Consumption The quality, volume, and speed of streaming content has profoundly changed media consumption patterns. Consumers can select from extensive catalogs of content across video programming, music, books, and gaming, among other categories, allowing for personalized, on-demand consumption anywhere, anytime, and at a great value. According to Kagan, a media research group of S&P Global Market Intelligence, global digital music paid subscribers are estimated to have grown from 12.1 million in 2012 to 162.5 million in 2018. Similarly, digital video paid subscribers are estimated to have increased in the United States from 37.6 million in 2012 to 167.8 million in 2018. Desire for Community and Shared Experiences We believe consumers are increasingly spending on experiences and are seeking meaningful community connections. Within the fitness industry, consumers have migrated to boutique fitness due to personalization, expert instruction, and the sense of community. Boutique-style fitness offerings are the fastest growing brick-and-mortar fitness category. According to IHRSA, as of 2017, 40% of members of health and fitness clubs reported belonging to a boutique fitness studio, and from 2013 to 2017, membership in boutique studios grew approximately 121%. Demand for Convenience Household trends, longer working hours, and the rise of mobile technology make it challenging to balance time between family, work, and personal health and wellness. According to the Pew Research Center, over the last few decades, there has been an increase in dual income families from 49% in 1970 to 66% in 2016. We believe that busy lifestyles, less free time, and changing household dynamics are driving demand for convenient fitness options. What Sets Us Apart Category-Defining Brand with Broad Appeal Peloton is the pioneer of connected, technology-enabled fitness. By meshing the physical and digital worlds, we have created an immersive experience that our Members love. We have scaled rapidly through data-driven marketing and 95 Table of Contents education-based sales efforts. Our marketing is made more efficient by the significant word-of-mouth referrals from our loyal Members, which has become one of our largest sales channels. As a result of strong Connected Fitness Product sales and low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, we have grown our Connected Fitness Subscribers from 35,135 as of June 30, 2016 to 511,202 as of June 30, 2019, representing annualized growth of approximately 144.1%. We are democratizing access to high-quality boutique fitness by making it accessible and affordable through the compelling value of our unlimited household Connected Fitness Subscriptions and attractive financing programs for the Bike and Tread. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal\u2014our fastest growing demographic segments are consumers under 35 years old and those with household incomes under $75,000. Growing and Scaled Platform with Network Effects As the largest interactive fitness platform in the world, our rapidly growing and scaled Member base is a highly strategic asset. With our first mover advantage, we have achieved critical mass, which improves our platform and Member experience. As of June 30, 2019, on average, nearly 6,400 Members participated in each cycling class, across live and on-demand. As our community of Members continues to grow, the Peloton fitness experience becomes more inspiring, more competitive, more immersive, and more connected. Over time, Members are embedded in the Peloton community and we become a part of their lives, increasing the opportunity cost of Members leaving or potential Members not joining our platform. Engaging-to-the-Point-of-Addictive Fitness Experience Drives High Retention By making fitness fun and motivating, we help our Members achieve their personal goals. We analyze millions of workouts per month to help us develop features that improve our Member experience and create new, on-trend fitness and wellness content that our Members crave. Engagement is the leading indicator of retention for our Connected Fitness Subscribers. We have consistently seen workouts increase over time. On average, our Connected Fitness Subscribers completed 7.5, 8.4, and 11.5 workouts per month in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. Usage drives value and loyalty, which is evidenced by our exceptional weighted-average 12-month Connected Fitness Subscriber retention rate of 95% across all fiscal year cohorts since fiscal 2016. Vertically Integrated Platform That is Difficult to Replicate We are driven by our Members-first obsession and see every Member touchpoint as an opportunity to exceed expectations. To create the best platform, we designed our own products, developed our own interactive software, and created our own high production value fitness and wellness programming. For full end-to-end Member support, we were also compelled to develop our own customer education, purchase and delivery, and services platform. We sell our Connected Fitness Products exclusively through our knowledgeable inside sales and showroom associates as well as our e-commerce site. Our high-touch delivery teams ensure that new Members are immediately set up and ready to work out on their new Bike or Tread. The effectiveness of our end-to-end platform is demonstrated by the high Net Promoter Score for our Bike, which has been within the range of 80 to 93 since we began measuring it in 2016. Compelling Financial Model Our financial profile is characterized by high growth, strong retention, recurring revenue, margin expansion, and efficient customer acquisition. Our growth is attributable to our data-driven marketing approach and Member word-of-mouth referrals, both of which help us generate predictable and increasingly efficient Connected Fitness Product sales. Our low Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, combined with our high Subscription Contribution Margin, results in attractive Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value. We offset customer acquisition costs with the gross profit earned on our Connected Fitness Products, generating rapid payback of sales and marketing investments and robust unit economics. Founder-Led, Passionate Team Peloton was founded by John Foley in 2012. Along with his four co-founders, John set out to create the most convenient and immersive indoor cycling experience in the world. Our founders believed deeply that creating a Members-first experience would require Peloton to be as vertically integrated as possible, and so we built teams that span software development, product design, fitness instruction, content production, marketing, music, logistics, retail, and apparel. We believe that no other company is at the intersection of all these disciplines, which means that every day we are doing something that no other company has done before. This, along with the positive impact we have on our Members\u2019 physical and mental well-being, fuels our passion for continuous innovation and progress. 96 Table of Contents Growth Strategies Our goal is to rapidly grow our Member base through the sale of our Connected Fitness Products while continuing to engage and retain our scaled and loyal community of Members. Grow Brand Awareness We are still in the early stages of growth in our existing markets. As of June 30, 2019, we had sold approximately 577,000 Connected Fitness Products globally, a small fraction of the 14 million products we believe reflect our current SAM. While our aided brand awareness has grown rapidly in the United States and reached 67% as of April 3, 2019, we have significant room to increase our brand and product awareness in both the United States and in our other geographies through television, digital, and social media marketing, as well as our showrooms and word-of-mouth referrals. We continue to broaden our demographic appeal by educating customers on the compelling value of our Connected Fitness Subscriptions. Continuously Improve Member Experience We constantly improve and evolve our interactive software and content to drive Member engagement, which helps us maintain our high retention rates as we grow. We deploy new software features frequently and currently produce over 950 original programs per month to keep our content library fresh and on-trend. We also continue to drive usage through innovative fitness and wellness programs and goal-based challenges that make Members feel more accountable and help them reach their personal goals. Total Workouts for our Connected Fitness Subscribers grew from 17.9 million in fiscal 2018 to 52.2 million in fiscal 2019, respectively, representing a 192% increase. For a definition of Total Workouts, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Key Operational and Business Metrics.\u201d Launch New Products and Expand Content Offering Over time, we plan to invest heavily in new product development and content to further penetrate our SAM. We will launch new Connected Fitness Products and accessories in our existing, as well as new fitness verticals, while continuously updating and expanding our original fitness and wellness programming. We will pursue new products where there is a large market opportunity in areas of fitness with staying power. Pursue Disciplined Expansion into New Geographies With more than 174 million people belonging to gyms globally, we believe there is significant opportunity for Peloton to grow internationally. In 2018, we began our international expansion and brought the Peloton experience to the United Kingdom and Canada. With our expansion into Germany in the winter of 2019, we will be in the largest fitness markets in the world. We will continue to pursue disciplined international expansion by targeting countries with high fitness penetration and spend, the presence of boutique fitness, and where we believe the Peloton value proposition will resonate. Invest in Our Platform We will continue to invest in technology and infrastructure to extend our leadership in connected fitness, increase our value proposition, and support our growth. Over the next couple of years, we will continue to invest in state-of-the-art production studios in New York City and London and a new headquarters in New York City, which will include a dedicated research and development facility for new product design, development, and testing. We will continue to invest heavily in a variety of software and hardware engineering functions, supply chain operations, manufacturing, and advanced quality assurance to support our growth. Increase Profitability Through Fixed Cost Leverage The continued growth of our Connected Fitness Subscriber base will allow us to improve Subscription Contribution Margin, increase Connected Fitness Subscriber Lifetime Value, and generate operating leverage. A significant portion of our content creation costs can be leveraged over time given that a limited number of production studios and instructors can support the future growth of our Subscriber base. We expect to drive continued efficiencies in sales and marketing expenses as we benefit from increasing brand awareness, word-of-mouth referrals from our growing Subscriber base, and further optimization of our sales and marketing investments by channel. We will also achieve operating leverage as we scale fixed general and administrative expenses, including those associated with our new headquarters in New York City. 97 Table of Contents Our Product Offerings Connected Fitness Products Our Connected Fitness Products include the Peloton Bike, launched in 2014, and the Peloton Tread, launched in 2018. Our Bike features a carbon steel frame, a nearly silent belt drive, magnetic resistance for durability, and a 22\u201d high-definition touchscreen with built-in stereo speakers to stream live and on-demand classes, all in a compact, 4\u2019 by 2\u2019 footprint. In the United States, we sell our Bike for $2,245, which includes delivery and set up. We offer qualified customers in the United States a 39-month, 0% APR financing program, allowing them to purchase the Bike and pay in monthly installments of $58.00. The Tread provides a one-of-a-kind experience for runners, strength trainers, and bootcamp enthusiasts. Like our Bike, the Tread has a state-of-the-art touch screen that allows Members to stream live and on-demand classes and is designed for performance and comfort. The Tread features a shock-absorbing rubber-slat belt and ball bearing system, ideal for low-impact training, while pace and incline knobs allow for seamless adjustments.

Currently our Tread is only available in the United States and sells for $4,295, which includes delivery and set up. We offer qualified customers a 24-month, 0% APR financing program, allowing them to purchase the Tread and pay in monthly installments of $179.00. [TABLE_294] Peloton Bike Peloton Tread Connected Fitness Subscriptions Our Connected Fitness Subscriptions are on a month-to-month basis, allow for multiple household users, and provide unlimited access to all live and on-demand classes. Our Connected Fitness Subscription allows Members to access classes through our Connected Fitness Products, compete on our motivating leaderboard, track performance metrics, and connect and interact with the broader Peloton community. Our Connected Fitness Subscription also includes access to our content through Peloton Digital which is available through iOS and Android mobile devices and most tablets and computers. Our Connected Fitness Subscriptions allow up to five Members of a household to access our content simultaneously. On average, we had 2.0 Members per Connected Fitness Subscription as of June 30, 2019. [TABLE_295] Subscription Content Bike Tread Digital 98 Table of Contents Peloton Digital Peloton Digital began as a companion app for Connected Fitness Subscribers to provide access to our classes while our Members were away from their Connected Fitness Products. Starting in June 2015, we offered Peloton Digital as a standalone fitness app. In June 2018, we relaunched Peloton Digital when we expanded our content offering to include bootcamp and indoor/outdoor running and walking classes. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 102,000 Peloton Digital Subscribers, in addition to our over 511,202 Connected Fitness Subscribers. A Digital Subscriber is an individual or household that has a paid Peloton subscription with a successful credit card billing. With over 67 million households in our current and announced markets open to subscription fitness, we believe there is ample opportunity for us to grow our Digital Subscription base over time. Today, Peloton Digital is included with all Connected Fitness Subscriptions. As of June 30, 2019, 50% of our Connected Fitness Subscribers used Peloton Digital to supplement their workout regime. Peloton Digital also helps us attract new Connected Fitness Subscribers by serving as an acquisition tool for new Members. Peloton Digital 99 Table of Contents Since the Peloton Digital relaunch in June 2018, we have added several new fitness verticals which we believe have increased the value of our subscription services. These include indoor/outdoor running and walking, bootcamp, strength training, stretching, and meditation. We have also significantly expanded our yoga offerings. Our Members have shown strong interest in these new verticals; in fiscal 2019, 35% of workouts completed were not indoor cycling classes. [TABLE_296] Peloton Total Fitness Experience Our Compelling Value Proposition Our monthly Connected Fitness Subscription at $39.00 is less expensive than most monthly gym memberships, a fraction of the price of a personal training session, and approximately the same price as one boutique fitness class for one person. Boutique studio fitness classes typically cost between $25.00 and $45.00 per class, per person and follow a rigid schedule whereas our monthly Connected Fitness Subscription covers the household and offers unlimited use, anytime, anywhere. Our live class schedule and on-demand library feature classes spanning five to 90 minutes, providing Members with flexibility and convenience. To increase affordability, we offer attractive 0% APR financing programs for our Connected Fitness Products. These programs allow our qualified customers to pay in monthly installments of as low as $58.00 for 39 months and $179.00 for 24 months for our Bike and Tread, respectively. Our financing programs have successfully broadened our base of Members by attracting consumers from a wider spectrum of ages and income levels. In fiscal 2019, approximately 50% of all Connected Fitness Products sold were financed. Existing Connected Fitness Subscribers provide a clear endorsement of the superior value of our offering. According to our 2019 Member Survey, the vast majority of our Members say that Peloton offers a better value than all other fitness alternatives. We strive to continuously improve our Member experience and value proposition through enhancements to our content and interactive software features. Our Vertically Integrated Fitness Platform Technology Our content delivery and interactive software platform are critical to our Member experience. We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform, develop new products and features, and improve our 100 Table of Contents platform infrastructure. Our research and development organization consists of world-class engineering, product, and design teams. Our teams have a diverse set of skills and industry experience, including expertise in highly scalable distributed systems, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and user-centric application engineering. Our engineering, product, and design teams work together to bring our products to life, from conception and validation to implementation. We constantly improve our existing Connected Fitness Products through frequent software updates with new and innovative interactive features. We are committed to leveraging data to continuously improve our Member experience by studying and understanding points of interaction and how our Members use our software features. Video streaming and storage are provided by third-party cloud providers. By leveraging these third parties, we are able to focus our resources on creating product enhancements and new software features. In addition, our technology platform is designed with redundancy and high availability in mind in order to minimize Member service disruption. Content and Music We create engaging-to-the-point-of-addictive original fitness and wellness content in an authentic live environment that is immersive, motivating, and encourages a sense of community. We combine high production value content with a broad catalogue of music to create a truly unique fitness experience our Members love. Content Development We use performance data to understand our Members\u2019 workout habits in order to evolve and optimize our programming around class type, length, music, and other considerations. We have developed a diverse content library with thousands of classes across an extensive range of class lengths, difficulty levels, and fitness preferences ranging from fun and flexible to structured and highly technical, all of which our Members easily access through filtering and search capabilities. We produce over 950 original programs per month from three production studios in New York City and London, with 29 instructors as of June 30, 2019, and across 10 fitness and wellness disciplines including indoor cycling, indoor/outdoor running and walking, bootcamp, yoga, strength training, stretching, meditation, and floor cardio. We entered into a long-term lease agreement at 5 Manhattan West in New York City in October 2018, which will serve as our fitness programming hub in North America and will feature four state-of-the-art production studios. We anticipate that this facility will open in Spring 2020. As we further expand internationally, we will develop localized content, as we have done in the United Kingdom where we produce content featuring three local instructors as of June 30, 2019. In December 2018, we entered into a long-term lease agreement at 11 Floral Street in London, England, which will serve as our fitness programming hub in Europe with three state-of-the-art production studios. As we expand into Germany and other non-English-speaking countries, we will produce classes in local languages from this location and use subtitling for our English-speaking programming. We may selectively open small, local studios to supplement our international programming. Instructors In front of the camera, our 29 celebrated instructors play a critical role in bringing the Peloton experience to life for our Members. Our instructors are not only authorities in their respective areas of fitness, but also relatable, magnetic personalities who inspire passionate followings. We offer a diverse cast of instructors that allows us to appeal to a broad audience of Members. Our instructors inspire our Members both on and off the camera and attend showroom openings and other Member-focused events where they meet and interact with our Members. Our Members feel connected to our instructors, and many Members travel from far distances to take a class at our New York City studios. 101 Table of Contents World Class Peloton Instructors 102 Table of Contents Production Team Behind the camera, our studio production teams are dedicated to creative excellence. We have top production talent representing decades of experience at major broadcast and cable networks, some of whom have won Emmy Awards for production excellence. Our teams provide dedicated creative support to our instructors before, during, and after live productions with the help of content performance data. We are focused on efficiency while maintaining high-quality production. All classes are shot in broadcast quality environments with a fraction of the staff and budget typical of a major network show. This allows us to deliver a constant stream of live-produced, authentic fitness and wellness programming with cinematic quality that provides clarity of instruction and entertainment value. Music and Music Technology We have developed a proprietary music platform that fuels the workout experience with thoughtfully curated playlists that align with our Members\u2019 musical preferences. We have over a million songs under license, representing the largest audiovisual connected fitness music catalog in the world. Our curated music is as diverse and dynamic as the Members we serve, delivering a custom-fit-and-finish musical experience created by instructors and music supervisors on our production team. We control the intersection of fitness and music in a deeply engaging way, motivating Members to achieve their fitness goals while discovering great music in the process. Peloton is a discovery resource for new artists and songs while also providing the opportunity for our Members to re-discover music they love. Members consistently rank the music we provide as one of their favorite aspects of the Peloton experience. We believe we have defined a new standard for musical content development in the fitness and wellness categories, which includes premiering new music, working with artists to co-curate classes based on their own music or influences, and partnering to create new music. We have applied, and will continue to apply, technological solutions to enhance our music platform including: [TABLE_297] \u2022 data-driven playlist recommendations for our instructors and music supervisors to use in developing class plans; [TABLE_298] \u2022 instructor-facing song search and filtering functions, including the ability to search by song length and BPM; [TABLE_299] \u2022 real-time music and content management and reporting; [TABLE_300] \u2022 for Members, a display of every song played in a class, including artist name and associated artwork; [TABLE_301] \u2022 ability for Members to \u201clike\u201d songs they discover anywhere on our platform and save it to their profile; and [TABLE_302] \u2022 integrations with Spotify and Apple Music, enabling Members to sync songs they hear on Peloton to their streaming service. 103 Table of Contents Music Rights Strategy We have built a world class music content management and reporting system to meet the needs of our music rights holders in order to support our highly-engaged, growing global community of over 1.4 million Members. Peloton is increasingly seen by our partners as an impactful music discovery platform, which has created opportunities to progressively and meaningfully enhance our classes with custom music experiences. We expect this to continue as we invest in music-first technology to improve the quality of our Members\u2019 experience, strengthen our competitive advantage over other fitness platforms, and add value to our Members. Sales and Marketing Our goal is to increase brand awareness and purchase intent for our Connected Fitness Products and subscriptions. We use a unique combination of brand and product-specific performance marketing to build brand awareness and generate predictable sales of our Connected Fitness Products. In just a few years, Peloton\u2019s aided brand awareness has grown significantly, and as of April 3, 2019, our aided brand awareness in the United States was 67%. Our marketing strategies have focused on product education and broadening our demographic reach. Our fastest growing demographic segments included Members under the age of 35 and Members making under $75,000 in annual household income. Video has been the strongest medium to communicate the features of the Peloton platform. We primarily market through advertisements on broadcast and cable television, social media, and over-the-top providers such as Hulu and YouTube to reach our target audience, focusing on incremental return on investment. Our direct-to-consumer model allows us to conduct frequent tests in our sales channels, including testing our brand creative and messages, allowing us to further optimize marketing spend. We also frequently test alternative marketing channels, such as podcasts and other forms of audio advertising, as well as direct mailing. Direct to Consumer, Multi-Channel Sales Model We sell our products directly to customers through a multi-channel sales platform that includes e-commerce, inside sales, and showrooms. Our sales associates use robust customer relationship management tools to deliver an elevated, personalized, and educational purchase experience, regardless of channel of capture and conversion. Integration and coordination across all sales channels is critical to the customer journey, evidenced by over 37% of our customers purchasing a product or service in a different channel than where they originally engaged with Peloton in fiscal 2019. [TABLE_303] \u2022 E-Commerce and Inside Sales: Our desktop and mobile websites, www.onepeloton.com, www.onepeloton.co.uk, and www.onepeloton.ca, provide an elevated brand experience where visitors can learn about our products and services and access product reviews. Our inside sales team engages with customers by phone, email, and online chat on our websites, and offers one-on-one sales consultations seven days a week. 104 Table of Contents [TABLE_304] \u2022 Showrooms: Our showrooms allow customers to experience and try our products. We provide interactive product demonstrations and many of our showrooms have private areas where customers can do a \u201ctest ride\u201d or \u201ctest run.\u201d We frequently host Peloton community events in our showrooms, which help deepen brand engagement and loyalty. [TABLE_305] \u2022 Commercial: The commercial and hospitality markets represent a small percentage of sales but are important to driving trial and brand awareness. Our Bikes in hospitality locations help keep our Members riding when they travel, creating further Member engagement, loyalty, and convenience. Across our markets as of June 30, 2019, there were 1,298 Peloton Bikes in 696 hotels and resorts. Showroom Site Strategy As of June 30, 2019, we operated 74 showrooms across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Our showrooms are located primarily in upscale malls, lifestyle centers, and premium street locations. When evaluating potential new markets, we carefully examine historical sales data, key demographics, traffic patterns, geographic locations, and co-tenancy of other complementary lifestyle-oriented retailers. In the United States, we attempt to cluster stores around major urban markets and suburbs while also operating in super regional and regional centers that draw from a greater trade area. In Canada and the United Kingdom, we will continue to focus on major urban markets. We target locations where we expect payback of one year or less and positive contributions to EBITDA within the first year of operation. We operate two showroom formats including our large showrooms which range from 1,500 to 2,000 square feet and \u201cmicrostores\u201d which are typically around 300 square feet. Large showrooms comprise 70% of our retail locations and provide space for Connected Fitness Products and Peloton-branded apparel, as well as private areas for \u201ctest rides\u201d and \u201ctest runs.\u201d Microstores represent 30% of our retail locations and are typically placed in highly visible \u201ccenter court\u201d areas. Our showroom leases are typically five to ten years in lease duration while microstores are typically open for up to 1.5 years. Microstores allow us to test markets and specific shopping areas, and provide a temporary location while searching for the ideal large showroom space. Retention Marketing & Member Support Services The retention marketing team is focused on driving engagement to help us maintain our high Connected Fitness Subscriber retention rates. The team develops new ways to promote engagement with our products and community or help Members reengage with our platform when activity has lapsed. The retention team helps curate goal-based challenges, awards digital badges for Member accomplishments, and sends Peloton-branded \u201cCentury Club\u201d shirts after a Member\u2019s 100 th class. The team also communicates with Members with no recent activity through email campaigns that help encourage these Members to get back to their workout routine. The retention marketing team also collects and responds to feedback about our platform that is on our closed Facebook group of over 180,000 Members as of June 30, 2019. In order to bring our community together, we organize several in-person events throughout the year including welcoming Members for workouts, milestone celebrations, and instructor meet-and-greets at our production studios in New York City. We also host Members at our showrooms, and celebrate our Members with our flagship Member event, Peloton Homecoming, held in New York City each May. At Peloton Homecoming 2019, we welcomed nearly 3,000 individuals to New York City to participate in three days of events including scheduled talks, a community celebration, and fitness classes. 105 Table of Contents The Member support team was created to serve all the needs of our customers and Members including sales support, scheduling, delivery, installation, account and billing inquiries, Connected Fitness Product trouble-shooting and repair, product education, returns and exchanges, and anything else our Members need. This team primarily operates in New York City and Plano, Texas. We also utilize some additional third-party support services in Ireland and North America to help us efficiently scale our team. Manufacturing We outsource the manufacturing of our products to multiple contract manufacturers located in Asia. The components used in our products are sourced either directly by us or on our behalf by our contract manufacturers from a variety of component suppliers. To continue to provide our Members with leading fitness technology, our supply chain team coordinates the relationships between our contract manufacturers and component suppliers. We regularly review our existing contract manufacturers and component suppliers, and evaluate new partners and suppliers, to ensure that we can scale our manufacturing base as we grow. We purchase from our primary contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. Under our governing agreements, our contract manufacturers must follow our established product design specifications, quality assurance programs, and manufacturing standards. We have developed preferred relationships with our partners to maintain access to the resources needed to scale seasonally and ensure our partners have the requisite experience to produce our Connected Fitness Products and accessories. We pay for and own certain tooling and equipment specifically required to manufacture our products to have control of supply and component pipelines. We have purchase commitments based on our purchase orders for certain amounts of goods, work-in-progress, and components. In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturers when possible, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, including maintaining adequate inventory of any single source components and products. To date, we have not experienced material delays in obtaining any of our components or products. At each of our manufacturers\u2019 facilities, we have a quality team that is involved throughout the entire development process. To ensure consistent quality, we routinely perform product audits on non-core suppliers and staff full-time supplier quality engineers at core product manufacturing sites. Logistics and Fulfillment To control every touchpoint of our product and service offering, we have built networks of last mile field operations centers, which have further expanded from the United States into Canada and the United Kingdom. With 24 locations in major markets of North America and two locations in the United Kingdom as of June 30, 2019, our field operations team supports in-home delivery of our Connected Fitness Products with professional high-touch set up service and ongoing in-home service and care. As highly trained experts on our products and services, our field specialists offer product education, assistance with account set up, and tips and recommendations for product care and content selection. As we grow our logistics network, we are able to efficiently service, deploy, and install replacement parts to our Members over time. With our commitment to our Members-first approach, we will continue to invest to strengthen our field operations\u2019 coverage in locations we identify as cost-effective delivery markets throughout North America and in new international regions. To further scale our distribution system and maintain flexibility, we also work with third-party fulfillment partners that deliver our products from multiple locations in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Third-party fulfillment partnerships allow us to reduce order fulfillment time, reduce shipping costs, and expand our geographical reach. Our field operations performed 58% of Connected Fitness Product deliveries during fiscal 2019. Intellectual Property The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information. As of June 30, 2019, we held six issued U.S. patents and had 22 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 13 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. issued patents expire between May 20, 2025 and July 16, 2034. As of 106 Table of Contents June 30, 2019, we held 10 registered trademarks in the United States, including the Peloton mark and our \u201cP\u201d logo and also held 63 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Government Regulation We are subject to many varying laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and throughout the world, including those related to privacy, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, consumer protection, e-commerce, marketing, advertising, messaging, rights of publicity, health and safety, employment and labor, product liability, accessibility, competition, and taxation. These laws often require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information, such as personal data, \u201cspecial categories of personal data\u201d or health data. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. In addition, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products and services or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all of our products and services for an extended period of time or indefinitely. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is intended to create a single legal framework that applies across all EU member states. However, there are certain areas where EU member states can deviate from the requirements in their own legislation. It is therefore likely that we will need to comply with these local regulations in addition to the GDPR. Local supervisory authorities are able to impose fines for non-compliance and have the power to carry out audits, require companies to cease or change processing, request information, and obtain access to premises. The GDPR created more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, requiring enhanced disclosures to data subjects about how personal data is processed (including information about the profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making), limiting retention periods of personal data, requiring mandatory data breach notification, and requiring additional policies and procedures to comply with the accountability principle under the GDPR. In addition, data subjects have more robust rights with regard to their personal data. Similarly, other jurisdictions are instituting privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which could increase our risk and compliance costs. Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom (after Brexit). We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the standard contract clauses, which have been subject to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. If these existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions are unavailable, we may be unable to transfer personal data of employees or Members in those regions to the United States. Competition We believe that our first-mover advantage, leading market position, brand recognition, and vertically integrated platform set us apart in the rapidly growing market for connected, technology-enabled fitness. We provide a superior value proposition and benefit from the clear endorsement of our Connected Fitness Subscribers, giving us a competitive advantage versus traditional fitness and wellness products and services, and future potential entrants. While we believe we are changing the consumption patterns for fitness and growing the market, the main sources of competition include in-studio fitness classes, fitness clubs, at-home fitness equipment and content, and health and wellness apps. The areas in which we compete include: [TABLE_306] \u2022 Consumers and Engagement. We compete for consumers to join our platform through Connected Fitness or Digital Subscriptions, and we seek to retain them through engagement and community. 107 Table of Contents [TABLE_307] \u2022 Product Offering. We compete with producers of fitness products and work to ensure that our Connected Fitness Products maintain the most innovative technology and user-friendly features. [TABLE_308] \u2022 Talent. We compete for talent in every vertical across our company including technology, media, fitness, design, logistics, music, marketing, finance, legal, and retail. As our platform is highly dependent on technology and software, we require a significant base of engineers to continue innovating. The principal competitive factors that companies in our industry need to consider include, but are not limited to: total cost, manufacturing efficiency, enhanced products and services, original content, product quality and safety, competitive pricing policies, vision for the market and product innovation, strength of sales and marketing strategies, technological advances, and brand awareness and reputation. We believe we compete favorably across all of these factors and we have developed a business model that is difficult to replicate. Culture and People [TABLE_309] The main group of riders in a race. Riders in a peloton work together, conserve energy and perform better because of one another. Mission and Values Like our brand, product, and content offerings, our culture is dynamic, unique, and framed by our expansive vision and passion for community and collaboration. For our people, the purpose and function of our culture is clear, and operates as a shared language of values and as a way of getting things done that permeates through the many areas in which we operate as a company. Our culture is shaped by our four primary values, described below: [TABLE_310] \u2022 Put Members First: We obsess over every touchpoint of our Member experience. We have a Member-centered mindset that prioritizes a positive product and brand experience. We are proud to be pioneers and innovators of a global, product-oriented, fitness-centered community. [TABLE_311] \u2022 Operate with a Bias for Action: We value innovation, continuous improvement, and challenging the status quo, all of which are keys to success in a competitive environment. We move quickly, take smart risks, fail fast and learn from failures. We never let the fear of imperfection stop us from achieving great things. [TABLE_312] \u2022 Empower Teams of Smart Creatives: We hire individuals who are great at what they do, and encourage all of our team members to think openly and creatively to solve tough, exciting problems. We empower our team members to think and act like owners. [TABLE_313] \u2022 Together We Go Far: As our company name suggests, we know the importance and value of a team. We know our collective differences make us stronger, and uphold the obligation to dissent and listen. We value inclusivity and we are proud that everyone can work to help solve difficult problems and have an impact. To foster these values, we have committed to promote our \u201cOne Peloton\u201d culture: [TABLE_314] \u2022 Best Place to Work : We offer generous benefits and compensation packages, including equity to all full-time employees, parental leave, health and wellness offerings, family planning assistance, and learning and development opportunities. [TABLE_315] \u2022 Commitment to Equal Pay : We conduct an annual third-party audit of team members\u2019 pay to confirm that our pay-for-performance philosophy transcends race and gender. If an audit reveals any pay differences unexplained by legitimate business factors between team members who hold similar jobs, but are of different races or genders, we adjust the affected team members\u2019 respective compensation accordingly. [TABLE_316] \u2022 Social Impact: Our \u201cComeback Initiative\u201d recognizes Members and non-Members nominated by themselves or others through sharing stories about their respective journeys back from a difficult time. Committees consisting of Peloton team members determine the individuals to recognize and, in turn, develop deeper connections to our community. Recognized individuals receive a Peloton Bike and three-year Connected Fitness Subscription. We believe this award offers motivation and encouragement to support those on their comeback journeys, while engaging and activating our community. Employees We are extremely proud of our team which embodies a diverse mix of backgrounds, industries, and levels of experience. As of June 30, 2019, we employed approximately 1,800 individuals in the United States across our New York City headquarters, 108 Table of Contents Plano campus, Atlanta office, showrooms, and 23 field operations warehouses. Internationally, we had 94 employees in the United Kingdom and Germany across corporate, showroom, and warehouse functions, 34 employees in Canada largely in showroom and warehouse roles, and 26 individuals in Taiwan across quality engineering and operations functions. Certain of our instructors are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA. However, we are not signatories to any agreements with SAG-AFTRA. With the exception of SAG-AFTRA, none of our domestic employees are currently represented by a labor organization or a party to any collective bargaining. We also hire additional seasonal employees in our field operations, member support, and showrooms during the holiday season. Facilities Our corporate headquarters are located in New York City, where we occupy facilities totaling approximately 65,000 rentable square feet under a lease that expires in 2027. We use these facilities primarily for technology, product design, research and development, sales and marketing, supply chain and logistics, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology. In November 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for our planned new corporate headquarters in New York City, which we intend to occupy by the fall of 2020 and which consists of approximately 312,000 square feet under a 16-year lease. We also have a Member support and sales team located in Plano, Texas, where we occupy approximately 28,000 rentable square feet under a lease that expires in 2023. In addition to our corporate headquarters and regional campus, we currently operate two small programming hubs in New York City where we produce our content and offer fitness classes. In December 2017, we entered into a twenty-year lease for approximately 36,000 rentable square feet in New York City, which will include four production studios and adjacent office space. In September 2018, we entered into a lease for 11 Floral Street in London, which will serve as our content production hub for Europe and has 31,150 rentable square feet. We expect to open this London location in Fall 2020. We currently operate a temporary production studio in London where we produce local indoor cycling content. We also lease office space and showrooms for our products in 74 locations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada as of June 30, 2019. We intend to procure additional space as we add employees and expand geographically. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future and that suitable additional space will be available to accommodate any expansion of our operations as needed. Legal Proceedings VR Optics On August 11, 2016, VR Optics, LLC, or VR Optics, filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that we are infringing U.S. Patent No. 6,902,513 titled \u201cInteractive fitness equipment,\u201d or the \u2019513 patent. On November 7, 2016, we filed counterclaims against VR Optics for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity and intentional interference with our contractual relationship with Villency Design Group, LLC, or VDG, a product design company we hired in 2012 to help design the Peloton Bike. We also filed an amended third-party complaint against VDG for breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and Eric Villency and Joseph Coffey, the owners of VR Optics and VDG, for intentional interference with our contractual relationship with VDG. Among other things, we seek to enforce VDG\u2019s contractual obligation to defend and indemnify us for intellectual property claims, including the patent claim asserted by VR Optics. On December 9, 2016, VR Optics and VDG moved to dismiss all our non-patent counterclaims. In response, we amended our counterclaims to add a new claim against VDG for its fraudulent concealment of a potential patent infringement claim against us when Mr. Villency and Mr. Coffey first sought to acquire the \u2019513 patent, which was prior to the expiration of our contract with VDG. On January 20, 2017, VR Optics, VDG, Mr. Villency, and Mr. Coffey filed a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint and one of our non-patent counterclaims against VR Optics. The motion to dismiss was denied on August 18, 2017. Fact discovery concluded on February 1, 2019. Expert discovery is complete. Summary judgment motions were filed by both parties in early July 2019 and decisions on them are pending. There is currently no trial date set. We intend to defend the claims made against us and to prosecute the counterclaims presented. Litigation, however, is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or settlement could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, litigation can involve significant management time and attention, and the cost of litigation can be expensive, regardless of outcome. 109 Table of Contents Downtown Music Publishing On March 19, 2019, Downtown Music Publishing LLC, ole Media Management, L.P., Big Deal Music, LLC, CYPMP, LLC, Peer International Corporation, PSO Limited, Peermusic Ltd., Peermusic III, Ltd., Peertunes, Ltd., Songs of Peer Ltd., Reservoir Media Management, Inc., The Richmond Organization, Inc., Round Hill Music LLC, The Royalty Network, Inc., and Ultra International Music Publishing, LLC filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Downtown Music Publ\u2019g LLC, et. al v. Peloton Interactive, Inc., alleging that we engaged in copyright infringement by using certain accused songs in classes without necessary licenses. The plaintiffs allege that they are music publishers that own or control the copyrights in numerous musical works that were synchronized by us without the plaintiffs\u2019 authorization. The complaint asserts a single claim for copyright infringement. It seeks injunctive relief, more than $150 million in damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The plaintiffs served us with the summons and complaint on March 21, 2019. On April 30, 2019, we answered the complaint and filed counterclaims against the original named plaintiffs and National Music Publishers\u2019 Association, Inc., a trade association, alleging that they coordinated to collectively negotiate licenses in violation of the antitrust laws. Our counterclaims also assert that the trade association tortiously interfered with Peloton\u2019s attempts to engage in direct negotiations with music publishers in violation of state law. The counterclaims seek injunctive relief, monetary damages (to be trebled under applicable statute), and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. An amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019 named additional plaintiffs Greensleeves Publishing Ltd., Me Gusta Music, LLC, Raleigh Music Publishing LLC, STB Music, Inc., and TuneCore, Inc. and identified additional musical works. We answered the amended complaint on June 14, 2019. On June 24, 2019, counter-defendants filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims, to which we filed an opposition on August 8, 2019. Discovery on the claims and counterclaims is ongoing in the case. We intend to defend the claims made against us and to prosecute the counterclaims presented. Litigation, however, is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or settlement could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. In addition, litigation can involve significant management time and attention, and the cost of litigation can be expensive, regardless of outcome.

Each of our current directors 113 Table of Contents will continue to serve until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal. Classified Board of Directors Our restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect upon the completion of this offering provides that, upon the completion of this offering, our board of directors will be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Upon expiration of the term of a class of directors, directors for that class will be elected for three-year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which that term expires. As a result, only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Each director\u2019s term will continue until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal.

Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the total number of directors. The classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management.

Director Independence Our Class A common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Under the rules of Nasdaq, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company\u2019s board of directors within a specified period of the completion of this offering. In addition, rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company\u2019s audit, compensation, and nominating, governance, and corporate responsibility committees be independent. Under rules, a director will only qualify as an \u201cindependent director\u201d if, in the opinion of that company\u2019s board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. We intend to satisfy the audit committee independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 as of the closing of this offering. Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether each director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his or her ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. As a result of this review, our board of directors determined that Mses. Boone and Thomas-Graham and Messrs. Blachford, Callaghan, Draft, and Hoag are \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of Nasdaq. In making these determinations, our board of directors reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director\u2019s business and personal activities and current and prior relationships as they may relate to us and our management, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director and the transactions involving them described in the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.\u201d 114 Table of Contents Lead Independent Director Our board of directors will adopt, effective prior to the completion of this offering, corporate governance guidelines that provide that one of our independent directors will serve as our lead independent director.

Annual Stock Option Grant . Commencing with our fiscal 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, on each annual meeting of stockholders, each non-employee director who is serving on our board of directors on, and will continue to serve on our board of directors immediately following, the date of such annual meeting will automatically be granted a stock option having an aggregate value of $250,000 based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.

Employee Benefit Plans We believe that our ability to grant equity-based awards is a valuable compensation tool that enables us to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, consultants, and directors by aligning their financial interests with those of our stockholders. The principal features of our equity incentive plans are summarized below. These summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual text of the plans, which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. 2015 Stock Plan Our board of directors adopted our 2015 Plan in April 2015, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders. Our board of directors, or a committee thereof appointed by our board of directors, administers the 2015 Plan and the awards granted thereunder. Awards under our 2015 Plan are for shares of our Class B common stock. The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options, which qualify for favorable tax treatment to their recipients under Section 422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options, as well as for the issuance of restricted stock awards, or RSAs. We may grant incentive stock options only to our employees. We may grant nonqualified stock options and RSAs to our employees, directors, and consultants. We refer to such employees, directors, or consultants who receive an award under our 2015 Plan as participants. The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum permitted term of options granted under our 2015 Plan is ten years. Options generally vest subject to continued service, and will cease to vest on the date a participant ceases to provide services to us and all then unvested options will be forfeited. Our board of directors, or a committee thereof, may provide for options to be exercised only as they vest or to be immediately exercisable with any shares issued on exercise being subject to our right of repurchase that lapses as the shares vest. Stock options granted under the 2015 Plan generally may be exercised, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a period of three months after the termination of the optionee\u2019s service to us, for a period of six months in the case of disability, for a period of 12 months in the case of death or such longer or shorter period as our compensation committee may provide, but in any event no later than the expiration date of the stock option. An RSA is an offer by us to sell shares subject to restrictions, which may vest based on time or achievement of performance conditions. The price, if any, of an RSA will be determined by our board of directors, or a committee thereof. Unless otherwise determined at the time of award, vesting will cease on the date the participant ceases to provide services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited to or repurchased by us. In the event there is a specified type of change in our capital structure without our receipt of consideration, such as a stock split, appropriate adjustments will be made as set forth in the 2015 Plan. In the event of a merger or consolidation, or in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, outstanding awards under our 2015 Plan shall be subject to the agreement evidencing the transaction (or, in the event the transaction does not include such an agreement, as determined by our board of directors), which need not treat all outstanding awards in an identical manner, and may include one or more of the following: (1) the continuation of the outstanding awards; (2) the assumption of the outstanding awards by the surviving corporation or its parent; (3) the substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of new options for the outstanding options and new RSAs for the outstanding RSAs; (4) the cancellation of vested stock options or RSAs in exchange for a payment equal to the value of the per share consideration payable to holders of our common stock in the transaction and, in respect of options, less the option\u2019s exercise price (this payment may be zero if the option or RSA has no value); (5) the cancellation of the outstanding awards for no consideration; (6) the suspension of the right to exercise options for a limited period if administratively necessary; or (7) the termination of early exercise rights so that outstanding awards may only be exercised for vested shares after the transaction. Our board of directors has discretion to accelerate, in whole or part, the vesting and exercisability of an option or other award in connection with a corporate transaction as described above. 121 Table of Contents As of June 30, 2019, we had reserved 84,008,954 shares of our Class B common stock for issuance under our 2015 Plan. As of June 30, 2019, options to purchase 64,602,124 shares had been granted and remained outstanding and 9,085,593 shares remained available for future grant. The stock options outstanding as of June 30, 2019 had a weighted-average exercise price of $22.05 per share. We also granted options to purchase 664,050 shares under the 2015 Plan subsequent to June 30, 2019, with an exercise price of $17.22 per share. Our 2019 Plan (described below) will be effective upon the date immediately prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. As a result, we will not grant any additional equity awards under the 2015 Plan following that date, and the 2015 Plan will terminate at that time. However, any outstanding stock options will remain outstanding, subject to the terms of our 2015 Plan and the applicable stock option agreements evidencing such awards, until such outstanding awards are exercised, or until they terminate or expire by their terms. Upon the effectiveness of our 2019 Plan, the shares reserved but not issued or subject to outstanding awards under our 2015 Plan will become available for grant and issuance under our 2019 Plan as Class A common stock. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan In 2019, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will become effective on the date immediately prior to the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part and will serve as the successor to our 2015 Plan. Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer the 2019 Plan to our compensation committee. Our 2019 Plan provides for the award of both incentive stock options, which are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code, and nonqualified stock options, as well as for RSAs, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance awards, and stock bonuses. We may grant incentive stock options only to our employees. We may grant all other types of awards to our employees, directors, and consultants. We refer to employees, directors, or consultants who receive an award under our 2019 Plan as participants. We reserved shares of our Class A common stock to be issued under our 2019 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan will increase automatically on July 1 of each of 2020 through 2029 by the number of shares of our Class A common stock equal to 5% of the total outstanding shares of all of our classes of common stock as of the immediately preceding June 30. However, our board of directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. In addition, the following shares will be available for grant and issuance under our 2019 Plan as shares of our Class A common stock (and any shares of our Class B common stock from our 2015 Plan that become available for grant under our 2019 Plan will be issued as Class A common stock): [TABLE_369] \u2022 shares subject to issuance upon exercise of any stock option or SAR granted under our 2019 Plan but which cease to be subject to the stock option or SAR for any reason other than exercise of stock options or SARs; [TABLE_370] \u2022 shares subject to awards granted under our 2019 Plan that are forfeited or are repurchased by us at the original issue price; [TABLE_371] \u2022 shares subject to awards granted under our 2019 Plan that otherwise terminate without such shares being issued; [TABLE_372] \u2022 shares surrendered, cancelled, or exchanged for cash or a different award (or combination thereof, but to the extent an award under the 2019 Plan is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan); [TABLE_373] \u2022 any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under our 2015 Plan on the effective date of our 2019 Plan; [TABLE_374] \u2022 shares that are subject to stock options or other awards granted under our 2015 Plan that cease to be subject to such options or other awards by forfeiture or otherwise after the effective date of our 2019 Plan; [TABLE_375] \u2022 shares issued under our 2015 Plan before the effective date of our 2019 Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options that are forfeited after the effective date of our 2019 Plan; [TABLE_376] \u2022 shares issued under our 2015 Plan that are repurchased by us at the original issue price; and [TABLE_377] \u2022 shares subject to stock options or other awards that are used to pay the exercise price of a stock option or withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award. No more than shares of our Class A common stock may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options under the 2019 Plan. 122 Table of Contents The exercise price of each stock option must be at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The maximum permitted term of options granted under our 2019 Plan is ten years. The compensation committee may provide for options to be exercised only as they vest or to be immediately exercisable with any shares issued on exercise being subject to our right of repurchase that lapses as the shares vest. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan generally may be exercised, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a period of three months after the termination of the optionee\u2019s service to us, for a period of 12 months in the case of death or disability, or such longer or shorter period as our compensation committee may provide, but in any event no later than the expiration date of the stock option. Stock options generally terminate immediately upon termination of employment for cause. An RSA is an offer by us to sell shares of our Class A common stock subject to restrictions, which may vest subject to continued service and/or the achievement of performance conditions. The price, if any, of an RSA will be determined by the compensation committee. Unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee at the time of award, vesting will cease on the date the holder of the RSA no longer provides services to us and unvested shares will be forfeited to or repurchased by us. SARs provide for a payment, or payments, in cash or shares of our Class A common stock, to the holder based upon the difference between the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of exercise and the stated exercise price at grant. SARs may vest subject to continued service and/or the achievement of performance conditions; provided that no SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date the SAR is granted. RSUs represent the right to receive shares of our Class A common stock at a specified date in the future, subject to continued service and/or the achievement of performance conditions. If an RSU has not been forfeited, then on the date specified in the RSU agreement, we will deliver to the holder of the RSU whole shares of our Class A common stock, cash, or a combination of our Class A common stock and cash. Performance awards cover shares of our Class A common stock and may be settled upon achievement of the pre-established performance conditions as provided in the 2019 Plan in cash, by issuance of the underlying shares, other property, or any combination of the foregoing. Stock bonuses may be granted as additional compensation for service or performance, and may be settled in the form of cash, Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, and may be subject to restrictions, which may vest subject to continued service and/or the achievement of performance conditions. In the event of a change in the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock without consideration by reason of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, consolidation, reclassification, spin-off, or similar change in our capital structure, appropriate proportional adjustments will be made to the number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan; the exercise prices, number, and class of shares subject to outstanding options or SARs; the number and class of shares subject to other outstanding awards; and any applicable maximum award limits with respect to incentive stock options. In the event of a corporate transaction which constitutes a change of control, any or all outstanding awards may be (1) continued by the company, if the company is the successor entity; (2) assumed or substituted by the successor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation, for substantially equivalent awards (including, but not limited to a payment in cash or other right to acquire the same consideration paid to stockholders of the company upon a change of control). In the event a successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute outstanding awards, then such awards will become fully vested and, as applicable, exercisable, immediately prior to the consummation of the proposed change of control. For purposes of the foregoing, any awards subject to outstanding performance-based criteria that are not assumed will be deemed earned and vested at 100% of target level unless otherwise indicated in an applicable award agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a change in control, any outstanding awards granted to our non-employee directors under the 2019 Plan will become vested and exercisable, as applicable, prior to the consummation of the change in control. A corporate transaction generally includes (1) a \u201cperson\u201d becoming the \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d of our securities representing more than 50% of our total voting power; (2) the consummation of our sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; (3) the consummation of our merger or consolidation with any other corporation, except where we retain at least 50% of our total voting power; (4) any other transaction which qualifies as a \u201ccorporate transaction\u201d under Section 424(a) of the Code wherein our stockholders give up all of their equity interest in us; or (5) a change in our effective control that 123 Table of Contents occurs on the date that a majority of members of our board is replaced during any 12-month period by members whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of our board of directors prior to the date of the appointment or election. All awards will be subject to clawback or recoupment pursuant to any compensation clawback or recoupment policy adopted by our board of directors or required by law during the term of service of the award holder, to the extent set forth in such policy or applicable agreement. Our 2019 Plan will terminate 10 years from the date our board of directors approves the plan, unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors. Our board of directors may amend or terminate our 2019 Plan at any time, subject to stockholder approval as may be required by applicable law or listing rules. No termination or amendment of the 2019 Plan may adversely affect any then-outstanding award without the consent of the affected participant. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2019, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2019 ESPP. The 2019 ESPP will become effective on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. We have adopted the 2019 ESPP in order to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of our Class A common stock at a discount following the date of this offering. Our 2019 ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code. We initially reserved shares of our Class A common stock for issuance under our 2019 ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2019 ESPP will increase automatically on July 1 of each of 2020 through 2029 by the number of shares equal to 1% of the total outstanding shares of all of our classes of common stock as of the immediately preceding June 30, provided that no more than shares may be issued over the term of the 2019 ESPP. However, our board of directors may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. Our board of directors has delegated its authority to administer the 2019 ESPP to our compensation committee. Employees eligible to participate in any offering pursuant to the 2019 ESPP generally include any employee that is employed by us or certain of our designated subsidiaries at the beginning of the offering period, provided that the committee may exclude employees who fail to meet certain service-based or other requirements to the extent permitted by law. Under our 2019 ESPP, eligible employees will be able to acquire shares of our Class A common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions. Generally, our eligible employees will be able to select a rate of payroll deduction between 1% and 15% of their base cash compensation. Our board of directors has the authority to amend or terminate our 2019 ESPP, provided that except in certain circumstances such amendment or termination may not materially impair any outstanding purchase rights without the holder\u2019s consent. Our 2019 ESPP will terminate on the tenth anniversary of its effective date, unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors. The 2019 ESPP will be administered through a series of offering periods, which in no event may be longer than 27 months. Each offering period may itself consistent of one or more purchase periods. Unless otherwise determined by the board of directors or compensation committee, the company currently intends to establish offering periods of 24-months, each consisting of four six-month purchase periods. The purchase price for shares of our Class A common stock purchased under our 2019 ESPP will be 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our Class A common stock on (1) the first business day of the applicable offering period and (2) the last business day of each purchase period in the applicable offering period, but in no event less than the par value of a share. No participant will have the right to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in an amount, when aggregated with purchase rights under all our employee stock purchase plans that are also in effect in the same calendar year, that have a fair market value of more than $25,000, determined as of the first day of the applicable purchase period, for each calendar year in which that right is outstanding. In addition, no participant will be permitted to purchase more than 2,500 shares of our Class A common stock during any one purchase period, or a lesser amount determined by our compensation committee. If the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock is changed by stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification, or similar change in our capital structure without consideration, then our compensation committee will proportionately adjust the number and class of common stock that is 124 Table of Contents available under the 2019 ESPP, the purchase price and number of shares any participant has elected to purchase as well as the maximum number of shares which may be purchased by participants. If we experience a change of control transaction, any offering period that commenced prior to the closing of the proposed change of control transaction will be shortened and terminated on a new purchase date. The new purchase date will occur on or prior to the closing of the proposed change of control transaction, and our 2019 ESPP will then terminate on the closing of the proposed change of control. 401(k) Plan We maintain a broad-based 401(k) plan that provides eligible U.S. employees with an opportunity to defer eligible compensation up to certain annual limits. As a tax-qualified retirement plan, contributions to the 401(k) plan are deductible by us when made, and contributions and earnings on those amounts are generally not taxable to the employees until withdrawn or distributed from the 401(k) plan. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers Our restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective in connection with the completion of this offering contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for: [TABLE_378] \u2022 any breach of the director\u2019s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; [TABLE_379] \u2022 any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; [TABLE_380] \u2022 unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the DGCL; or [TABLE_381] \u2022 any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws that will become effective in connection with the completion of this offering require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent not prohibited by the DGCL and allow us to indemnify other employees and agents as set forth in the DGCL. Subject to certain limitations, our restated bylaws also require us to advance expenses incurred by our directors and officers for the defense of any action for which indemnification is required or permitted. We have entered, and intend to continue to enter, into separate indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, and certain of our other employees, in addition to the indemnification provided for in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify our directors, officers, and key employees for certain expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and settlement amounts actually incurred by these individuals in any action or proceeding arising out of their service to us or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which these individuals provide services at our request. Subject to certain limitations, our indemnification agreements also require us to advance expenses incurred by our directors, officers, and key employees for the defense of any action for which indemnification is required or permitted. We believe that provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, restated bylaws, and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, and key employees. We also maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. 125 Table of Contents At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or executive officers as to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, executive officers, or persons controlling us, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 126 Table of Contents CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In addition to the compensation arrangements discussed in the sections titled \u201cManagement\u201d and \u201cExecutive Compensation,\u201d the following is a description of each transaction since July 1, 2016 and each currently proposed transaction in which: [TABLE_382] \u2022 we have been or are to be a participant; [TABLE_383] \u2022 the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000; and [TABLE_384] \u2022 any of our directors, executive officers, or holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of these individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to you. We expect to adopt a restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws that will become effective upon the completion of this offering, and this description summarizes provisions that are expected to be included in these documents. For a complete description, you should refer to our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws, which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and to the applicable provisions of Delaware law. Upon the completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of shares of our Class A common stock, $0.000025 par value per share, shares of our Class B common stock, $0.000025 par value per share, and shares of undesignated preferred stock, $0.000025 par value per share. Assuming the conversion and reclassification of all outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common stock, which will occur in connection with the completion of this offering, as of June 30, 2019, there were outstanding: [TABLE_422] \u2022 zero shares of our Class A common stock; [TABLE_423] \u2022 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, held by approximately 428 stockholders of record; [TABLE_424] \u2022 64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, with a weighted-average exercise price of $6.71 per share; and [TABLE_425] \u2022 240,000 shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant, with an exercise price of $0.19 per share. Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock Dividend Rights Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and then only at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine. See the section titled \u201cDividend Policy\u201d for additional information. Voting Rights Holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of Class A common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to 20 votes for each share of Class B common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Following this offering, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock will hold % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, with our directors, executive officers, and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding % of the voting power in the aggregate. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of stockholders, unless otherwise required by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation. Delaware law could require either holders of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances: [TABLE_426] \u2022 if we were to seek to amend our restated certificate of incorporation to increase or decrease the par value of a class of our capital stock, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and [TABLE_427] \u2022 if we were to seek to amend our restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special rights of a class of our capital stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment. Our restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors. As a result, the holders of a majority of our voting shares can elect all of the directors then standing for election. Our restated certificate of incorporation establishes a classified board of directors, to be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. 134 Table of Contents No Preemptive or Similar Rights Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to redemption or sinking fund provisions. Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions Upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock and any participating preferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to the prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights of and the payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any shares of preferred stock outstanding at that time. Change of Control Transactions In the case of any distribution or payment in respect of the shares of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock upon a merger or consolidation with or into any other entity, or other substantially similar transaction, the holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be treated equally and identically with respect to shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock owned by them, unless the only difference in the per share distribution to the holders of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock is that any securities distributed to the holder of a share Class B common stock have 20 times the voting power of any securities distributed to the holder of a share of Class A common stock, or such merger, consolidation, or other transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, each voting as a separate class. Subdivisions and Combinations If we subdivide or combine in any manner outstanding shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, the outstanding shares of the other class will be subdivided or combined in the same manner, unless different treatment of the shares of each class is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, each voting as a separate class. Conversion Each outstanding share of Class B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon any transfer, whether or not for value, which occurs after the closing of this offering, except for certain permitted transfers described in our restated certificate of incorporation, including transfers to family members, trusts solely for the benefit of the stockholder or their family members, and partnerships, corporations, and other entities exclusively owned by the stockholder or their family members. Once converted or transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock may not be reissued. All the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock will convert automatically into shares of our Class A common stock upon the date that is the earlier of (i) the date specified by a vote of the holders of 66 2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii) ten years from the closing of this offering, and (iii) the date the shares of Class B common stock cease to represent at least 1% of all outstanding shares of our common stock. Following such conversion, each share of Class A common stock will have one vote per share and the rights of the holders of all outstanding common stock will be identical. Once converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock may not be reissued. Preferred Stock Pursuant to the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, each currently outstanding share of redeemable convertible preferred stock will automatically be converted into one share of Class B common stock effective upon the completion of this offering. Following this offering, no shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock will be outstanding. Following the completion of this offering, our board of directors will be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions, in each case without further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock 135 Table of Contents and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. Stock Options As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 64,602,124 shares of our Class B common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $6.71 per share, pursuant to our 2015 Plan. Since June 30, 2019, we have granted options to purchase an aggregate of 664,050 shares of our Class B common stock, with an exercise price of $22.05 per share, pursuant to our 2015 Stock Plan. Warrant As of June 30, 2019, we had outstanding a warrant to purchase 240,000 shares of our Class B common stock at an exercise price of $0.19, which expires in June 2025. The warrant has a cashless exercise provision pursuant to which the holder, in lieu of paying the exercise price in cash, can surrender the warrant and receive a net number of shares based on the fair market value of such shares at the time of exercise, after deducting the aggregate exercise price. Registration Rights We will pay the registration expenses (other than underwriting discount and stock transfer taxes) of the holders of the shares registered for sale pursuant to the registrations described below. In an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter, if any, has the right, subject to specified conditions, to limit the number of shares such holders may include. In connection with the completion of this offering, substantially all of our stockholders that have registration rights agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain terms and conditions and provided that if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred and (3) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. See the section titled \u201cUnderwriting\u201d for additional information. Following the completion of this offering, the holders of certain outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and the holders of shares of our Class B common stock issuable upon conversion of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, or their permitted transferees, will be entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act. These shares are referred to as registrable securities. Immediately following this offering, there will be approximately registrable securities outstanding. These rights are provided under the terms of our fourth amended and restated investors\u2019 rights agreement between us and the holders of these shares, which was entered into in April 2019, and include requested registration rights, Form S-3 registration rights, and piggyback registration rights. In any registration made pursuant to such amended and restated investor rights agreement, all fees, costs, and expenses of underwritten registrations, including fees and disbursements of one special counsel to the selling stockholders, will be borne by us and all selling expenses, including the estimated underwriting discount, will be borne by the holders of the shares being registered. However, we will not be required to bear the expenses in connection with the exercise of the requested and Form S-3 registration rights of a registration if the request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the selling stockholders holding a majority of registrable securities to be registered. The registration rights terminate upon the earlier of (1) five years following the completion of this offering or (2) as to any given holder of registration rights, at such time following this offering when such holder of registration rights (a) can sell all of such holder\u2019s registrable securities in compliance with Rule 144(b)(1)(i) or (b) holds 1% or less of our outstanding common stock and all registrable securities held by such holder can be sold in any three-month period without registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act and without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144(c)(1). Requested Registration Rights The holders of an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common stock following this offering, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to demand registration rights. Under the terms of the amended and restated investor rights agreement, if we receive a written request, at any time after the earlier of (1) August 30, 2025 or (2) six months following the effective date of this offering, from the holders of at least 50% of the registrable securities then outstanding that we file a 136 Table of Contents registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of outstanding registrable securities, then we will be required, within 20 days of receipt of the written request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to register, as soon as practicable, all of the shares requested to be registered for public resale, if the amount of registrable securities to be registered will have aggregate gross proceeds (before underwriting discount) of at least $20.0 million. We are required to effect only three registrations pursuant to this provision of the amended and restated investor rights agreement. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement no more than once during any 12-month period for up to 90 days if our board of directors determines that the filing would be detrimental to us and our stockholders. We are not required to effect a requested registration under certain additional circumstances specified in the amended and restated investor rights agreement. Form S-3 Registration Rights The holders of an aggregate of 210,640,629 shares of our Class B common stock following this offering or their permitted transferees are also entitled to Form S-3 registration rights. The holders of at least 30% of the registrable securities then outstanding can request that we register all or part of their shares on Form S-3 if we are eligible and qualified to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and if the aggregate price to the public of the shares offered is at least $5.0 million. The stockholders may require us to effect at most two registration statements on Form S-3 in any 12-month period. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 no more than once during any 12-month period for up to 90 days if our board of directors determines that the filing would be detrimental to us and our stockholders. We are not required to effect a registration on Form S-3 under certain additional circumstances specified in the amended and restated investor rights agreement. Piggyback Registration Rights If we register any of our securities for public sale, the holders of an aggregate of shares of our Class B common stock following this offering or their permitted transferees are entitled to piggyback registration rights. However, this right does not apply to a registration relating to sales of securities of participants in one of our stock plans, a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt securities or a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or other transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act. The underwriters of any underwritten offering will have the right, in their sole discretion, to limit, because of marketing reasons, the number of shares registered by these holders, in which case the number of shares to be registered will be apportioned, first, to us, and second, pro rata among these holders, according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included by each holder, subject to additional circumstances specified in the amended and restated investor rights agreement. Anti-Takeover Provisions The provisions of Delaware law, our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws, as we expect they will be in effect upon the completion of this offering, could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company. These provisions, which are summarized below, may have the effect of discouraging takeover bids. They are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms. Delaware Law We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, regulating corporate takeovers. In general, DGCL Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder unless: [TABLE_428] \u2022 prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; [TABLE_429] \u2022 the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder, (1) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (2) shares owned by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or 137 Table of Contents [TABLE_430] \u2022 at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. Generally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction or series of transactions together resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of directors does not approve in advance. We also anticipate that DGCL Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders. Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaw Provisions Our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws will include a number of provisions that could deter hostile takeovers or delay or prevent changes in control of our management team, including the following: [TABLE_431] \u2022 Dual Class Common Stock . As described above in the section titled \u201c\u2014Common Stock\u2014Voting Rights,\u201d our restated certificate of incorporation will provide for a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which holders of our Class B common stock will have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. Current investors, executives, and employees will have the ability to exercise significant influence over those matters. [TABLE_432] \u2022 Board of Directors Vacancies . Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws will authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors is permitted to be set only by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire board of directors. These provisions would prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and then gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. This makes it more difficult to change the composition of our board of directors but promotes continuity of management. [TABLE_433] \u2022 Classified Board . Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws will provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors. The existence of a classified board of directors could discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is more difficult and time consuming for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified board of directors. See the section titled \u201cManagement\u2014Board of Directors Composition\u201d for additional information. [TABLE_434] \u2022 Directors Removed Only for Cause . Our restated certificate of incorporation will provide that stockholders may remove directors only for cause. [TABLE_435] \u2022 Supermajority Requirements for Amendments of Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws . Our restated certificate of incorporation will further provide that the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock will be required to amend certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, including provisions relating to the classified board, the size of the board, removal of directors, special meetings, actions by written consent, and designation of our preferred stock. In addition, the affirmative vote of holders of 75% of the voting power of each of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, voting separately by class, will be required to amend the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation relating to the terms of our Class B common stock. The affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of voting stock will be required to amend or repeal our restated bylaws, although our restated bylaws may be amended by a simple majority vote of our board of directors. [TABLE_436] \u2022 Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders . Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our lead independent director, or our chief executive officer. Our restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our stockholders may not take action by written consent, but may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders. As a result, holders of our capital stock would not be able to amend our restated bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of our stockholders called in accordance with our restated bylaws. Further, our restated bylaws will provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of 138 Table of Contents [TABLE_437] our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors, our lead independent director, or our chief executive officer, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting. These provisions might delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for stockholders to take any action, including the removal of directors. [TABLE_438] \u2022 Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations . Our restated bylaws provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. Our restated bylaws also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice. These provisions might preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders if the proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions might also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. [TABLE_439] \u2022 No Cumulative Voting . The DGCL provides that stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws will not provide for cumulative voting. [TABLE_440] \u2022 Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock . After the filing of our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, or other means. [TABLE_441] \u2022 Choice of Forum . Our restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims that are vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or for which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For instance, the provision would not preclude the filing of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder in federal court. Listing We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cPTON.\u201d Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for our Class A common stock is American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. The transfer agent\u2019s address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, and its telephone number is (800) 937-5449. 139 Table of Contents SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our Class A common stock, and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options in the public market following this offering could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities. Following the completion of this offering, based on the number of shares of our capital stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, we will have a total of shares of our Class A common stock outstanding and 235,942,233 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding. This includes shares that we are selling in this offering, which shares may be resold in the public market immediately following this offering, and assumes no additional exercise of outstanding options. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. The remaining outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be deemed \u201crestricted securities\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which rules are summarized below. As a result of the lock-up agreements and market standoff provisions described below and subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or Rule 701, shares will be available for sale in the public market as follows: [TABLE_442] \u2022 beginning on the date of this prospectus, all of the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be immediately available for sale in the public market; [TABLE_443] \u2022 beginning 181 days after the date of this prospectus, additional shares of common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below; provided that if (1) if at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (3) the lock-up period as described below is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior a blackout period, beginning on the date that is ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period, such additional shares shall become eligible for sale in the public market; and [TABLE_444] \u2022 the remainder of the shares of common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time thereafter upon subject to vesting and, in some cases, to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below. Lock-Up Agreements and Market Stand Off Provisions All of our directors, executive officers, and substantially all of the holders of our common stock, or securities exercisable for or convertible into our common stock outstanding immediately prior to this offering, are subject to lock-up agreements or market standoff provisions that, subject to exceptions described under the section titled \u201cUnderwriting\u201d below, prohibit them from offering for sale, selling, contracting to sell, granting any option for the sale of, transferring or otherwise disposing of any shares of our common stock, stock options, or any security or instrument related to this common stock, or stock option for a period of at least 180 days following the date of this prospectus, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; provided that if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred and (3) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. These agreements are subject to certain customary exceptions. See the section titled \u201cUnderwriting\u201d for additional information. Rule 144 In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, once we have been subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for at least 90 days, a person who is not deemed to have been one of our 140 Table of Contents affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, is entitled to sell those shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144 and the requirements of the lock-up and market standoff agreements, as described above. If such a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, then that person would be entitled to sell those shares (subject to the requirements of the lock-up and market standoff agreements, as described above) without complying with any of the requirements of Rule 144. In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell upon expiration of the lock-up and market standoff provisions described above, within any three-month period, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of: [TABLE_445] \u2022 1% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after this offering; or [TABLE_446] \u2022 the average weekly trading volume of our Class A common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to that sale. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. Rule 701 Rule 701 generally allows a stockholder who purchased shares of our capital stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but without being required to comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares, however, are required by that rule to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling those shares pursuant to Rule 701. Moreover, all Rule 701 shares are subject to lock-up agreements and or market standoff agreements as described above and under the section titled \u201cUnderwriting\u201d and will not become eligible for sale until the expiration of those agreements. Registration Statements In connection with this offering, we intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering all of the shares of our Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options and the shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans. We expect to file this registration statement as soon as permitted under the Securities Act. However, the shares registered on Form S-8 may be subject to the volume limitations and the manner of sale, notice, and public information requirements of Rule 144 and will not be eligible for resale until expiration of the lock-up and market standoff agreements to which they are subject. Registration Rights We have granted demand, Form S-3, and piggyback registration rights to certain of our stockholders to sell our common stock. Registration of the sale of these shares under the Securities Act would result in these shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration, except for shares purchased by affiliates. See the section titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock\u2014Registration Rights\u201d for additional information. 141 Table of Contents MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK The following summary describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our Class A common stock acquired in this offering by Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxes, does not discuss the potential application of the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare Contribution tax on net investment income, and does not deal with state or local taxes, U.S. federal gift, and estate tax laws, except to the limited extent provided below, or any non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to Non-U.S. Holders in light of their particular circumstances. Special rules different from those described below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders that are subject to special treatment under the Code, such as: [TABLE_447] \u2022 insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions; [TABLE_448] \u2022 tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations) and tax-qualified retirement plans; [TABLE_449] \u2022 \u201cqualified foreign pension funds\u201d as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the Code and entities all of the interests of which are held by qualified foreign pension funds; [TABLE_450] \u2022 persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to our Class A common stock being taken into account in an applicable financial statement; [TABLE_451] \u2022 non-U.S. governments and international organizations; [TABLE_452] \u2022 broker-dealers and traders in securities; [TABLE_453] \u2022 U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; [TABLE_454] \u2022 persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent of our Class A common stock; [TABLE_455] \u2022 \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations,\u201d \u201cpassive foreign investment companies,\u201d and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; [TABLE_456] \u2022 persons that hold our Class A common stock as part of a \u201cstraddle,\u201d \u201chedge,\u201d \u201cconversion transaction,\u201d \u201csynthetic security,\u201d or integrated investment or other risk reduction strategy; [TABLE_457] \u2022 persons who do not hold our Class A common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, for investment purposes); and [TABLE_458] \u2022 partnerships and other pass-through entities, and investors in such pass-through entities (regardless of their places of organization or formation). Such Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local, and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them. Furthermore, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code, and Treasury regulations, rulings, and judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof, and such authorities may be repealed, revoked, or modified, possibly retroactively, and are subject to differing interpretations which could result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. We have not requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions or will not take a contrary position regarding the tax consequences described herein, or that any such contrary position would not be sustained by a court. PERSONS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THIS OFFERING SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ACQUIRING, OWNING, AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION, INCLUDING ANY STATE, LOCAL, OR NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OR ANY U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, AND THE POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF TAX TREATIES. For the purposes of this discussion, a \u201cNon-U.S. Holder\u201d is a beneficial owner of Class A common stock that is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A \u201cU.S. Holder\u201d means a beneficial owner of our Class A 142 Table of Contents common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (1) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes), created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. If you are an individual non-U.S. citizen, you may, in some cases, be deemed to be a resident alien (as opposed to a nonresident alien) by virtue of being present in the United States for at least 31 days in the calendar year and for an aggregate of at least 183 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year. Generally, for this purpose, all the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year, and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year, are counted. Resident aliens are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax as if they were U.S. citizens. Individuals who are uncertain of their status as resident or nonresident aliens for U.S. federal income tax purposes are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of our Class A common stock. Distributions We do not expect to make any distributions on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do make distributions on our Class A common stock, however, such distributions made to a Non-U.S. Holder of our Class A common stock will constitute dividends for U.S. tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that is applied against and reduces, but not below zero, a Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in our Class A common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or exchange of our Class A common stock as described below under \u201c\u2014Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock.\u201d Any distribution on our Class A common stock that is treated as a dividend paid to a Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected with the holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business in the United States will generally be subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the United States and the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s country of residence. To obtain a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be required to provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other appropriate form, certifying the Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s entitlement to benefits under that treaty. Such form must be provided prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If a Non-U.S. Holder holds stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on the holder\u2019s behalf, the holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to such agent. The holder\u2019s agent will then be required to provide certification to the applicable withholding agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. If you are eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax under an income tax treaty, you should consult with your own tax advisor to determine if you are able to obtain a refund or credit of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS. We generally are not required to withhold tax on dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder that are effectively connected with the holder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment that the holder maintains in the United States) if a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI, stating that the dividends are so connected, is furnished to the applicable withholding agent. In general, such effectively connected dividends will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated rates applicable to U.S. persons. A corporate Non-U.S. Holder receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional \u201cbranch profits tax,\u201d which is imposed, under certain circumstances, at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty) on the corporate Non-U.S. Holder\u2019s effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments. See also the section below titled \u201c\u2014Foreign Accounts\u201d for additional withholding rules that may apply to dividends paid to certain foreign financial institutions or non-financial foreign entities. Gain on Disposition of Our Class A Common Stock Subject to the discussions below under the sections titled \u201c\u2014Backup Withholding and Information Reporting,\u201d a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with respect to gain realized on a sale or other 143 Table of Contents disposition of our Class A common stock unless (1) the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of the holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment that the holder maintains in the United States), (2) the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual and is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met, or (3) we are or have been a \u201cUnited States real property holding corporation\u201d within the meaning of Code Section 897(c)(2) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding such disposition or the holder\u2019s holding period in the Class A common stock. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder described in (1) above, you will be required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to U.S. persons. Corporate Non-U.S. Holders described in (1) above may also be subject to the additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. If you are an individual Non-U.S. Holder described in (2) above, you will be required to pay a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, which gain may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (even though you are not considered a resident of the United States), provided you have timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses. With respect to (3) above, in general, we would be a United States real property holding corporation if United States real property interests (as defined in the Code and the Treasury Regulations) comprised (by fair market value) at least half of our assets. We believe that we are not, and do not anticipate becoming, a United States real property holding corporation. However, there can be no assurance that we will not become a United States real property holding corporation in the future. Even if we are treated as a United States real property holding corporation, gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder on a disposition of our Class A common stock will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax so long as (1) the Non-U.S. Holder owned, directly, indirectly, or constructively, no more than five percent of our Class A common stock at all times within the shorter of (i) the five-year period preceding the disposition or (ii) the holder\u2019s holding period and (2) our Class A common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market. There can be no assurance that our Class A common stock will qualify as regularly traded on an established securities market. U.S. Federal Estate Tax The estates of nonresident alien individuals generally are subject to U.S. federal estate tax on property with a U.S. situs. Because we are a U.S. corporation, our Class A common stock will be U.S. situs property and, therefore, will be included in the taxable estate of a nonresident alien decedent, unless an applicable estate tax treaty between the United States and the decedent\u2019s country of residence provides otherwise. The terms \u201cresident\u201d and \u201cnonresident\u201d are defined differently for U.S. federal estate tax purposes than for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal estate tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of our Class A common stock. Backup Withholding and Information Reporting Generally, we or certain financial middlemen must report information to the IRS with respect to any dividends we pay on our Class A common stock, including the amount of any such dividends, the name and address of the recipient, and the amount, if any, of tax withheld. A similar report is sent to the holder to whom any such dividends are paid. Pursuant to tax treaties or certain other agreements, the IRS may make its reports available to tax authorities in the recipient\u2019s country of residence. Dividends paid by us (or our paying agents) to a Non-U.S. Holder may also be subject to U.S. backup withholding. U.S. backup withholding generally will not apply to a Non-U.S. Holder who provides a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the holder is a U.S. person. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. information reporting and backup withholding requirements generally will apply to the proceeds of a disposition of our Class A common stock effected by or through a U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or non-U.S., unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing non-U.S. person status or otherwise establishes an exemption. Generally, U.S. information reporting and backup withholding requirements will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a Non-U.S. Holder where the transaction is effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker. Information reporting and backup withholding requirements may, however, apply to a payment of disposition proceeds if the broker has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the holder is, in fact, a U.S. person. For information reporting purposes only, certain U.S. related brokers may be treated in a manner similar to U.S. brokers. 144 Table of Contents Backup withholding is not an additional tax. If backup withholding is applied to you, you should consult with your own tax advisor to determine whether you have overpaid your U.S. federal income tax, and whether you are able to obtain a tax refund or credit of the overpaid amount. Foreign Accounts In addition, U.S. federal withholding taxes may apply under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, on certain types of payments, including dividends on our Class A common stock, made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on our Class A common stock paid to a \u201cforeign financial institution\u201d or a \u201cnon-financial foreign entity\u201d (each as defined in the Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution agrees to undertake certain diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any \u201csubstantial United States owners\u201d (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. The 30% federal withholding tax described in this paragraph cannot be reduced under an income tax treaty with the United States. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain \u201cspecified United States persons\u201d or \u201cUnited States-owned foreign entities\u201d (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of dividends on our common stock, and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock on or after January 1, 2019, although under recently proposed regulations (the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on such proposed regulations pending finalization), no withholding would apply with respect to payments of gross proceeds. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in our Class A common stock. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, HOLDING, AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGE IN APPLICABLE LAW, AS WELL AS TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. OR U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS SUCH AS ESTATE AND GIFT TAX. 145 Table of Contents UNDERWRITING We and the underwriters named below will enter into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares of Class A common stock being offered. Subject to certain conditions, each underwriter will severally agree to purchase the number of shares indicated in the following table. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are the representatives of the underwriters. [TABLE_459] Underwriters Number of Shares Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC J.P. Morgan Securities LLC BofA Securities, Inc. Barclays Capital Inc. UBS Securities LLC Cowen and Company, LLC Canaccord Genuity LLC Evercore Group L.L.C. JMP Securities LLC KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Needham & Company, LLC Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Telsey Advisory Group LLC Academy Securities, Inc. Siebert Cisneros Shank & Co., LLC R. Seelaus & Co., LLC The Williams Capital Group, LP Total The underwriters will commit to take and pay for all of the shares being offered, if any are taken, other than the shares covered by the option described below unless and until this option is exercised. The underwriters have an option to buy up to an additional shares of Class A common stock in this offering to cover sales by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than the total number set forth in the table above. They may exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as set forth in the table above. 146 Table of Contents The following table shows the per share and total underwriting discount to be paid to the underwriters by us. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares of our Class A common stock. [TABLE_460] Paid by Us No Exercise Full Exercise Per share $ $ Total $ $ A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web sites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in the initial public offering. The underwriters may agree to allocate a number of shares to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to underwriters and selling group members that may make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $ per share from the initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the shares, the representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms. Sales of shares made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriters. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters\u2019 right to reject any order in whole or in part. We and our executive officers, directors, and holders of substantially all of our common stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock have agreed or will agree with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of our or their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; provided that if (1) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (2) we have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (3) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. We will announce the date of any expected blackout-related release to the lock-up at least two trading days in advance of such release. This agreement does not apply to any existing employee benefit plans. See the section titled \u201cShares Eligible for Future Sale\u201d for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions. Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares of our Class A common stock. The initial public offering price has been negotiated between the representatives and us. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be our historical performance, estimates of our business potential and earnings prospects of the company, an assessment of our management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses. Neither we nor the underwriters can assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our Class A common stock or that the shares will trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price. We have applied to list our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cPTON.\u201d In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of Class A common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions, and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A \u201ccovered short position\u201d is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters\u2019 option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In 147 Table of Contents determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option described above. \u201cNaked\u201d short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Class A common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of Class A common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of our Class A common stock. As a result, the price of our Class A common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These transactions may be effected on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. We estimate that our share of the total expenses of the offering, excluding underwriting discount, will be approximately $ . We have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for certain expenses incurred by them in connection with this offering. We have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Other than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the underwriters that would permit a public offering of the securities offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The securities offered by this prospectus may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this prospectus or any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the offer and sale of any such securities be distributed or published in any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this prospectus comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the distribution of this prospectus. This prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful. The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to us and to persons and entities with relationships with us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In June 2019, we entered into the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and Silicon Valley Bank, as joint syndication agents, which amended and restated the loan and security agreement that we previously entered into in November 2017. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million secured revolving credit facility, including up to the lesser of $150.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the facility for the issuance of letters of credit. The principal amount, if any, is payable in full in June 2024. As of June 30, 2019, we had not drawn on the credit facility and did not have outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. See the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows and changes in redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 deficit for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2018 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2017.

As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were substantially held in money market and operating accounts. At various times during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, the balances of cash at financial institutions exceeded the federally insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes cash and cash equivalents are not subject to any significant credit risk. F-8 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in reserve accounts related to operating lease obligations. Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances The Company\u2019s accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from third-party sales processors. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible, which to date have not been material, and provides allowances, as necessary, for doubtful accounts. Revenue Recognition Adoption of Topic 606 On July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and all subsequent amendments. The Company elected to apply the standard and all related ASUs retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented. The adoption of the new standard had no material impact on the measurement or recognition of revenue, resulting in no adjustments to the prior periods. Additional disclosures, however, have been added in accordance with ASU 2014-09. Refer to Note 3, Revenue. Shipping and Delivery Fees The Company accounts for shipping, delivery and installation fees, net of discounts and refunds, billed to customers as revenue. Sales Taxes Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities is not included in revenue and is reflected as a liability on the balance sheet. Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods, which are generally purchased from contract manufacturers. Connected Fitness Product, accessories, and apparel inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a weighted-average cost basis. The Company assesses the valuation of inventory and periodically adjusts the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions, as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. Spare parts are recorded as inventory and recognized in cost of goods sold as consumed. Marketable Securities The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as available-for-sale and, accordingly, records them at fair value. Marketable securities with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as current investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as current based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Unrealized holding gains and losses, which are immaterial, are excluded from earnings and are reported net of tax in other comprehensive income until realized. Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses, are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. For leasehold improvements, the useful life is the lesser of the applicable lease term or the expected asset life. Charges for repairs and maintenance that do F-9 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes the cost of pre-production tooling which it owns during a supply arrangement. Pre-production tooling and engineering costs the Company will not own or will not be used in producing products under long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred. Internal-Use Software The Company capitalizes certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software. The Company evaluates the costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and website development to determine whether the costs meet the criteria for capitalization. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities including maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed three years. Capitalized costs less accumulated amortization are included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest, if any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired developed technology. At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is calculated and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded. The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value. Cost of Revenue Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue consists of product costs, including manufacturing costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses associated with supply chain logistics. F-10 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Subscription Subscription cost of revenue includes costs associated with content creation and cost to stream content to our Members across the Company\u2019s platform. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including studio rent and occupancy, other studio overhead and instructor and production personnel costs, and variable costs, including music royalty fees, content costs for past use, third-party platform streaming costs, and payment processing fees for our monthly subscription billings. Music Royalty Fees The Company recognizes music royalty fees on all music it streams to Members as these fees are incurred in accordance with the terms of the relevant license agreement with the music rights holder. The incurrence of the royalties is primarily driven by content usage by the Company\u2019s Members on a fee-per-play basis through the use of the Company\u2019s Subscriptions and classified within subscription cost of revenue within the Company\u2019s statement of operations. The Company\u2019s license agreements with music rights holders generally include provisions for advance royalties as well as minimum guarantees. When a minimum guarantee is paid in advance, the guarantee is recorded as a prepaid expense and amortized to subscription cost of revenue. As the Company executes music license agreements with various music rights holders for go-forward usage, the Company may also simultaneously enter into a settlement agreement whereby the Company is released from all potential licensor claims regarding the Company\u2019s alleged past use of copyrighted material in exchange for a negotiated payment. These are referred to as \u201ccontent costs for past use\u201d and are recorded within subscription cost of revenue. The Company has entered into agreements with music rights holders who represent all the music catalogs that the Company needs to operate its service, however, given the uncertain and opaque nature of music rights ownership, the Company\u2019s archived library may continue to include music for which certain rights or fractional interests have not been accurately determined or fully licensed. Prior to the execution of a music license agreement, the Company estimates and records a charge based upon license agreements previously entered into and the market share and size of the music rights holder. Income Taxes The Company utilizes the asset and liability method for computing its income tax provision. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent the Company believes recovery is not likely, establishes a valuation allowance. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within income tax expense. Research and Development Costs Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel- and facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials and software platform expenses. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving existing products and services. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, research and development costs were $13.0 million, $23.4 million, $54.8 million, respectively. F-11 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and are recognized as expense, net of actual forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For performance-based options issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and expensed over the vesting term under an accelerated attribution method when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock awards issued is affected by a number of variables, including the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock, the expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the options, the expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company derives its volatility from the average historical stock volatilities of several peer public companies over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. The Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201d options, as the Company\u2019s historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected dividend yield is 0.0% as the Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying dividends on its common stock. Generally, the Company\u2019s stock options plans permit early exercise. The unvested portion of shares exercised is recorded as a liability on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and reclassified to equity as vesting occurs. Common Stock Valuations The Company has historically granted stock options at exercise prices equal to the fair value as determined by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) on the date of grant. In the absence of a public trading market, the Board of Directors, with input from management, exercises significant judgment and consider numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of the Company\u2019s common stock as of the date of each stock option grant, including: [TABLE_467] \u2022 relevant precedent transactions involving the Company\u2019s capital stock; [TABLE_468] \u2022 the liquidation preferences, rights, preferences, and privileges of the Company\u2019s redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to the common stock; [TABLE_469] \u2022 the Company\u2019s actual operating and financial performance; [TABLE_470] \u2022 current business conditions and projections; [TABLE_471] \u2022 the Company\u2019s stage of development; [TABLE_472] \u2022 the likelihood and timing of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying the stock options, such as an initial public offering, given prevailing market conditions; [TABLE_473] \u2022 any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability of the common stock underlying the granted options; [TABLE_474] \u2022 recent secondary stock sales and tender offers; [TABLE_475] \u2022 the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and [TABLE_476] \u2022 U.S. and global capital market conditions. In addition, the Board of Directors considers the independent valuations completed by a third-party valuation consultant. The valuations of the Company\u2019s common stock are determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Share Repurchases Shares of the Company\u2019s common and preferred stock may be repurchased from time to time as authorized by the Board of Directors. Share repurchases are funded from existing cash balances, and repurchased shares are retired and returned to F-12 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS unissued authorized shares. These repurchases are accounted for as reductions to the Company\u2019s common and preferred stock to the extent available with remaining amounts allocated against retained earnings. Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, among others, those related to income taxes, the realizability of inventory, stock-based compensation, contingencies, revenue-related reserves, content costs for past use reserve, fair value measurements, useful lives of property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill, intangible, and long-lived assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurement or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: [TABLE_477] \u2022 Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. [TABLE_478] \u2022 Level 2 inputs are based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. [TABLE_479] \u2022 Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities, and typically reflect management\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company\u2019s material financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. The carrying values of the Company\u2019s accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their fair values at June 30, 2018 and 2019, due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment. Earnings (Loss) Per Share The Company computes net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common F-13 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. The Company\u2019s redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. The Company considers any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock. These participating securities do not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in the Company\u2019s losses. As such, net losses for the periods presented were not allocated to the Company\u2019s participating securities. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants as well as the redeemable convertible preferred shares. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2019, the excess of the repurchase price of preferred stock over its carrying value (see Note 12) has been recorded as an increase to net loss to determine net loss attributable to common stockholders. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted ASU 2014-09 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance, and requires companies to recognize revenue based upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires disclosures related to the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company applied the five-step method outlined in ASU 2014-09 to all revenue streams and elected the full retrospective method for its adoption of the standard as of July 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The additional disclosures required by ASU 2014-09 are included in Note 3, Revenue. ASU 2016-09 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 , Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. For all other entities, including emerging growth companies, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09 as of July 1, 2017. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company applied the guidance on a modified retrospective basis, which resulted in a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment and increase to accumulated deficit as of July 1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2018 did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-01 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business . The standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, the assets acquired are not considered a business. For public entities, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. For all other entities, including emerging growth companies, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods F-14 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2017-01 as of July 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-09 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting , to provide clarity and reduce both diversity in practice and cost complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718 to a change to the terms and conditions of a stock-based payment award. ASU 2017-09 also provides guidance about the types of changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award that require an entity to apply modification accounting in accordance with Topic 718. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods therein. The Company adopted this update as of July 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-15 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customer\u2019s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract . ASU 2018-15 requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred over the noncancelable term of the cloud-computing arrangements plus any optional renewal periods (1) that are reasonably certain to be exercised by the customer or (2) for which exercise of the renewal option is controlled by the cloud service provider. The effective date of this pronouncement for public entities is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, including emerging growth companies, the standard is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The standard can be adopted either using the prospective or retrospective transition approach. The Company early adopted ASU 2018-15 using the prospective approach as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted ASU 2016-02 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases . ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to separate the lease components from the non-lease components in a contract and recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public entities, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. For all other entities, including emerging growth companies, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company early adopted ASU 2016-02 using the modified retrospective approach as of July 1, 2019. Based upon the Company\u2019s lease portfolio and evaluation of the standard, the Company estimates the adoption will result in the addition of $400 million to $500 million of right-of-use-assets and liabilities to the consolidated balance sheet, with no significant change to the consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Additionally, the Company estimates an approximate $147 million decrease in assets and liabilities due to the de-recognition of the build-to-suit asset and liability. ASU 2017-04 In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The standard is effective for public entities for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting years beginning after December 15, 2019. For all other entities, including emerging growth companies, the standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in annual reporting years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. F-15 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Revenue The Company\u2019s primary source of revenue is from sales of its Connected Fitness Products and associated recurring subscription revenue. The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: [TABLE_480] \u2022 identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer [TABLE_481] \u2022 identification of the performance obligations in the contract [TABLE_482] \u2022 determination of the transaction price [TABLE_483] \u2022 allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract [TABLE_484] \u2022 recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company\u2019s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company\u2019s revenue is reported net of sales returns and discounts, which to date have not been material to the Company\u2019s financial statements. The Company estimates its liability for product returns based on historical return trends by product category and seasonality and an evaluation of current economic and market conditions and records the expected customer refund liability as a reduction to revenue, and the expected inventory right of recovery as a reduction of cost of revenue. If actual return costs differ from previous estimates, the amount of the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted in the period in which such costs occur. Some of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For customer contracts that include multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling price based on prices charged to customers. Connected Fitness Products Connected Fitness Products include the Company\u2019s Bike and Tread, related accessories, associated fees for delivery and installation, and extended warranty agreements. The Company recognizes Connected Fitness Product revenue net of sales returns and discounts when the product has been delivered to the customer. The Company generally allows customers to return products within thirty days of purchase, as stated in its return policy. The Company records fees paid to third-party financing partners in connection with its consumer financing program as a reduction of revenue, as it considers such costs to be a customer sales incentive. The Company records payment processing fees for its credit card sales for Connected Fitness Products within selling and marketing expenses. Subscription The Company\u2019s subscriptions provide unlimited access to content in its library of live and on-demand fitness classes. The Company\u2019s subscriptions are offered on a month-to-month basis. Historically, the Company offered a prepaid subscription option where Subscribers earned one free month or three free months of subscription with the purchase of a 12-month subscription or 24-month subscription, respectively. The Company also offered Subscribers the ability to finance the prepaid subscription with the purchase of a Connected Fitness Product as part of its financing program. The associated financing fees were paid to the Company\u2019s third-party partner at the outset of the arrangement and are recorded as a reduction to subscription revenue. The Company terminated both programs in July 2018. Amounts paid for subscription fees are included within customer deposits and deferred revenue and recognized ratably on a month-to-month basis. F-16 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company generates a small portion of its revenue from the sale of studio credits to attend and participate in a live, instructor-led class at its New York City studios. Studio revenue is recognized at the time the credits are redeemed and used. Product Warranty The Company offers a standard product warranty that its Connected Fitness Products will operate under normal, non-commercial use for a period of one-year from the date of original delivery. The Company has the obligation, at its option, to either repair or replace the defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenue. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include historical as well as current product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures, and warranty policies. The Company\u2019s products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, and in certain cases, the Company may have recourse to such contract manufacturers. The Company also offers the option for customers in some markets to purchase a third-party extended warranty and service contract that extends or enhances the technical support, parts, and labor coverage offered as part of the base warranty included with the Connected Fitness Product for an additional period of 12 to 27 months. Revenue and related fees paid to the third-party provider are recognized on a gross basis as the Company has a continuing obligation to perform over the service period. Extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the extended warranty coverage period and is included in Connected Fitness Products revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Disaggregation of Revenue The Company\u2019s revenue from contracts with customers disaggregated by major product lines, excluding sales-based taxes, are included in Note 17, Segment Information. The Company\u2019s revenue disaggregated by geographic region, based on ship-to address, were as follows: [TABLE_485] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (in millions) North America (1) $ 218.6 $ 435.0 $ 897.9 United Kingdom \u2014 \u2014 17.1 Total revenue $ 218.6 $ 435.0 $ 915.0 [TABLE_486] (1) Consists of United States and Canada Customer Deposits and Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue is recorded for nonrefundable cash payments received for the Company\u2019s performance obligation to transfer, or stand ready to transfer, goods or services in the future. Deferred revenue consists of subscription fees billed that have not been recognized. Customer deposits represent payments received in advance before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer and are refundable. As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, customer deposits of $85.6 million and $81.3 million, and deferred revenue of $2.9 million and $9.5 million, respectively, were included in customer deposits and deferred revenue on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company recognized $1.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each period. F-17 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Exemptions and Elections The Company applies the practical expedient as per ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information related to remaining performance obligations due to their original expected durations being one year or less.

Debt and Financing Arrangements 2015 Debt Financing Facility In June 2015, the Company entered into a $3.0 million senior secured term loan facility (as amended from time to time, the \u201cTerm Loan Agreement\u201d) with Silicon Valley Bank (\u201cSVB\u201d), maturing on June 1, 2019. The term loan was repayable in 36 scheduled installments commencing on July 1, 2016. Principal outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement accrued interest, payable monthly, at a floating rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus 1.50%. In June 2015, the Company entered into a three-year, $32.0 million secured revolving credit facility with SVB (as amended from time to time, the \u201c2015 Credit Agreement\u201d). The amount that could be borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement was based upon a borrowing base formula with respect to the Company\u2019s trailing three-month revenue and outstanding liability balances. Borrowed funds accrued interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus 0.25%. Amounts owed under the Term Loan Agreement and 2015 Credit Agreement (collectively, the \u201cSVB Debt Facility\u201d) were guaranteed by the Company. The Company also granted security interests in substantially all of its assets to collateralize these obligations. The Company had the option to repay its borrowings under the SVB Debt Facility without penalty prior to maturity. As of June 30, 2017, there was $2.0 million of principal outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement of the SVB Debt Facility. In November 2017, the Company terminated the SVB Debt Facility and repaid the remaining $1.6 million principal outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of that date. The Company recognized a loss of approximately $0.1 million in November 2017 related to the write-off of the unamortized balance of loan fees on the SVB Debt Facility. 2018 Revolving Credit Facility In November 2017, the Company entered into a four-year, $100.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the \u201c2018 Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which serves as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, and SVB, as joint syndication agents, which replaced the SVB Credit Facility. Interest on the 2018 Credit Agreement was paid based on LIBOR plus a predetermined margin or base rate. The Company was required to pay a commitment fee of 0.375% based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. In connection with the execution of the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $1.2 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, which are capitalized and were being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2018 Credit Agreement. Amended and Restated Credit Agreement In June 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement (\u201cAmended Credit Agreement\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, lead arranger and bookrunner and Bank of America, N.A., Barclays Bank PLC, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC and SVB, as joint syndication agents, which amended and restated the 2018 Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million secured revolving credit facility, including up to the lesser of $150.0 million and the aggregate unused amount of the facility for the issuance of F-21 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS letters of credit. Interest on the Amended Credit Agreement is paid based on LIBOR plus 2.75% or an Alternative Base Rate plus 1.75%. The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.375% on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The Company incurred total commitment fees of $0.2 million and $0.3 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively, which are included in interest expense in the statements of operations. The principal amount, if any, is payable in full in June 2024. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had not drawn on the credit facility and did not have outstanding borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement. In connection with the execution of the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $0.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, which are being capitalized and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. The remaining unamortized deferred financing fees of $0.7 million related to the 2018 Credit Agreement were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company has the option to repay its borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement without premium or penalty prior to maturity. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and delivery of borrowing base certificates, as well as customary covenants that restrict its ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain financial condition covenants, including maintaining a total level of liquidity of not less than $125.0 million and maintaining certain minimum total revenue ranging from $725.0 million to $1,985.0 million depending on the applicable date of determination. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. At June 30, 2019, the Company was contingently liable for approximately $40.1 million in standby letters of credit as security for its operating lease and inventory purchasing obligations. 11. Commitments and Contingencies Lease Obligations The Company leases facilities under operating leases with various expiration dates through 2039. The Company\u2019s corporate headquarters is located in New York, New York. The Company also leases space for the operation of its production studio facilities, retail showrooms, microstores, warehouses, and office spaces. Certain of the Company\u2019s lease agreements contain renewal options, rent escalation clauses, rent holidays or landlord incentives. Landlord incentives are capitalized within deferred rent and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease. Rent expense for non-cancellable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any applicable rent holidays, beginning on the date of initial possession, which is generally the date when the Company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for intended use. The excess of straight-line rent expense over the scheduled payment amounts and landlord incentives is recorded as a deferred rent obligation. The Company has the option to extend or renew most of its leases, which may increase the future minimum lease commitments. The Company\u2019s lease agreements for its retail showrooms generally provide for a fixed minimum rental plus contingent rent, which is determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels. Rent expense under existing operating lease agreements was $8.0 million, $15.1 million, and $35.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

The 5 Manhattan West Lease contains a renewal option for two additional five-year periods. The 5 Manhattan West Lease includes a tenant improvement allowance in the future amounting to $3.0 million. This allowance will be reflected as a reduction in rent expense over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statements of operations and as a leasehold improvement and other liability in the consolidated balance sheets. In November 2018, the Company entered into a 16-year operating lease agreement for space to be used as its new corporate headquarters. The lease is expected to commence in August 2019, upon the date the Company takes possession of the leased space and commits the Company to $503.0 million in minimum fixed payments over the term of the lease.

Peloton Interactive, Inc., alleging that the Company engaged in copyright infringement by using certain accused songs in streaming and recorded fitness classes without necessary licenses. The plaintiffs allege that they are music publishers that own or control the copyrights in numerous musical works that were synchronized by the Company without the plaintiffs\u2019 authorization. The complaint asserts a single claim for copyright infringement. It seeks injunctive relief, up to $150 million in damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend the claim. On April 30, 2019, the Company answered the complaint and filed counterclaims against the original named plaintiffs and National Music Publishers\u2019 Association, Inc., a trade association, alleging that they coordinated to collectively negotiate licenses in violation of the antitrust laws. The counterclaims also assert that the trade association tortuously interfered with the Company\u2019s attempts to engage in direct negotiations with music publishers in violation of state law. The counterclaims seek injunctive relief, monetary damages (to be trebled under applicable statute), and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. An initial pretrial conference was held on May 9, 2019 and discovery has commenced. An amended complaint filed on May 31, 2019 named additional plaintiffs Greensleeves Publishing Ltd., Me Gusta Music, LLC, Raleigh Music Publishing LLC, STB Music, Inc., and TuneCore, Inc. and identified additional musical works. The Company answered the amended complaint on June 14, 2019. On June 24, 2019, counter-defendants filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims, to which the Company filed an opposition on August 8, 2019. Discovery on the claims and counterclaims is ongoing in the case. While the Company cannot predict what the ultimate result of any judgment against, or settlement by, the Company, will be in this matter, based on application of ASC 450, \u201cContingencies\u201d, at June 30, 2019, the Company has accrued its best estimate within a range of reasonably possible outcomes ranging from $4.0 million to $11.0 million, which is included in F-24 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC.

In addition to the above, from time to time, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that the outcome of any existing litigation, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Company. 12. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders\u2019 Equity Stock Split In August 2018, the Company effected a 4-for-1 stock split on its shares of common stock.

Common Stock In connection with the conversion to a corporation in April 2015, the Company authorized common stock with a par value of $0.000025 per share. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, there were 266,946,216 and 400,000,000 shares of common stock authorized, respectively, and 25,936,848 and 25,301,604 shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. Warrant Transactions In June 2015, the Company issued 240,000 common stock warrants in connection with the Term Loan Agreement with SVB (see Note 10). The warrants were initially recorded at their fair value calculated using the Black-Scholes model, with the following weighted-average assumptions: exercise price of $0.19 per share, price of $0.19 per share, expected term of 10 years, risk-free rate of 2.35%, and volatility of 90%. The fair value of the warrants of $38,000 was recorded as deferred financing costs and such costs were amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the loan. In connection with the termination of the SVB Debt Facility in November 2017, the Company recognized the remaining balance of unamortized deferred financing costs, including the amount related to the warrants, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (see Note 10).

In May 2017, the Company filed an amendment to the certificate of incorporation which decreased the authorized number of shares of common stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock, to a total of 266,946,216 shares, 27,169,432 shares, 49,375,076 shares, and 31,635,604 shares, respectively. In March 2017, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which it sold and issued 40,624,492 shares of its newly created Series E Preferred Stock at a purchase price of approximately $5.42 per share (the \u201cSeries E Share Price\u201d) in an initial closing. Between April 1, 2017 and May 31, 2017, the F-25 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Company sold and issued an additional 19,388,988 shares of Series E Preferred Stock in a series of subsequent closings (combined, the \u201cSeries E Financing\u201d). The aggregate gross proceeds from the Series E Financing were approximately $325.0 million. The Company incurred issuance costs of $9.4 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 in connection with the Series E Financing, which are recorded as a reduction of the Series E Preferred Stock share balance. In connection with closing of the Series E Financing, the Company used approximately $175.0 million of the proceeds from the Series E Financing to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock from certain existing stockholders at the Series E Share Price. The repurchase occurred through a series of share repurchase transactions in conjunction with the initial and subsequent closings of the Series E Financing, in addition to a tender offer made by the Company following the closing of the Series E Financing (the \u201c2017 Tender Offer\u201d). The 2017 Tender Offer was made to certain existing equity holders of the Company to repurchase shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock and options to purchase such shares of capital stock from such equity holders at a gross repurchase price equal to the Series E Share Price. The aggregate gross repurchase amounts under the Series E Financing closings and the 2017 Tender Offer were $122.7 million and $52.3 million, respectively. In connection therewith, the Company repurchased 9,717,464 shares of common stock, 2,381,576 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 1,504,660 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, 5,290,300 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and 13,420,940 shares of Series D Preferred Stock each at the Series E Share Price. The repurchased shares were retired and considered authorized, but not issued or outstanding, pursuant to the Company\u2019s third amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The repurchase price of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, including closing costs, of $118.7 million exceeded the carrying value of $26.4 million at the date of repurchase. For the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the repurchase price in excess of the then carrying value of the Preferred Stock of $92.3 million was recorded as a reduction to net loss in computing net loss attributable to common stockholders. In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $8.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, which represents the excess of the tender offer repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased which were held by employees and is included within general and administrative operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. For shares sold by stockholders who were not employees, the Company recorded the excess of the tender offer repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased as a reduction to retained earnings. The Company recorded a reduction in redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 equity, net of closing costs, of $161.6 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 for the share repurchase transaction. In connection with the share repurchase transactions, the Company incurred transaction costs of $4.4 million directly related to the share repurchase, which are recorded as a reduction in stockholders\u2019 equity as of June 30, 2017.

The Company incurred issuance costs of $10.9 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 in connection with the Series F Financing, which were recorded as a reduction of the Series F Preferred Stock share balance. In connection with the closing of the Series F Financing, the Company used approximately $130.0 million of the proceeds from the Series F Financing to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series E Preferred Stock from certain existing stockholders at the Series F Share Price. The repurchase occurred through a tender offer made by the Company following the closing of the Series F Financing (the \u201c2018 Tender Offer\u201d). The 2018 F-26 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Tender Offer was made to certain existing equity holders of the Company to repurchase shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock and options to purchase such shares of capital stock from such equity holders at a gross repurchase price equal to the Series F Share Price. In connection therewith, the Company repurchased 5,503,479 shares of common stock, 1,091,444 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, 1,100,257 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, 998,368 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and 570,970 shares of Series E Preferred Stock each at the Series F Share Price. The repurchased shares were retired and considered authorized, but not issued or outstanding, pursuant to the Company\u2019s fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The repurchase price of the redeemable convertible preferred stock, including closing costs, of $54.4 million exceeded the carrying value of $4.3 million at the date of repurchase. For the computation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the repurchase price in excess of the then carrying value of the Preferred Stock of $50.1 million was recorded as a reduction to net loss in computing net loss attributable to common stockholders. In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $28.2 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, which represents the excess of the tender offer repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased which were held by employees and is included within operating expenses in the statements of operations. For shares sold by stockholders who were not employees, the Company recorded the excess of the tender offer repurchase price over the fair value of the shares repurchased as a reduction to retained earnings. The Company recorded a reduction in redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u2019 equity, on a gross basis, of $104.8 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 for the share repurchase transaction. In connection with the share repurchase transactions, the Company incurred transaction costs of $2.7 million directly related to the share repurchase, which are recorded as a reduction in stockholders\u2019 deficit as of June 30, 2019. Pursuant to ASC 718-10-25-15, the Company reflects the substantive terms of its employee share-based payments in accounting for the arrangements. With the 2018 Tender Offer, the Company believes that it has established a pattern of cash settlement of immature shares and stock options only during a very discrete set of circumstances in which the Company opens a tender offer in conjunction with preferred stock financing. As such, during the 2018 Tender Offer period, the Company recorded a liability equal to the fair value of the maximum number of options representing immature shares that could have been redeemed in the tender offer. To the extent that this liability exceeded amounts previously recognized in equity, the excess was recognized as additional stock-based compensation expense. Following the closing of the 2018 Tender Offer, the remaining liability after the repurchase of tendered shares was reclassified to stockholders\u2019 equity. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $33.5 million associated with this tender offer. Dividends The holders of shares of preferred stock, in preference to the holders of common stock, are entitled to receive dividends upon declaration by the Board of Directors. Such dividends are non-cumulative and are payable at a per annum rate of eight percent of the original share issue price. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, no dividends have been declared or distributed to any stockholders. Conversion Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, at its holder\u2019s discretion, into one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock. The conversion rate shall be adjusted whenever the Company shall issue or sell, or is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of common stock for a consideration per share less than the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale. The Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock upon the consummation of a qualified initial public offering at a public offering price of not less than $30.0 million in the aggregate. The Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock upon the consummation of an initial public offering at a public offering price of not less than $75.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, at any time prior to consummation of an initial public offering, F-27 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock upon the affirmative election of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series C Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to common stock basis; (2) all of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock upon the affirmative election of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock; (3) all of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock upon the affirmative election of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock; and (4) all of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be automatically converted into common stock upon the affirmative election of holders of at least 55% of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock. Upon any such automatic conversion, any declared and unpaid dividends shall be paid. Liquidation Preferences In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and common stock, shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company that are legally available for distribution, an amount equal to the applicable original issue price per share, for each share of Preferred Stock held by them, plus all declared but unpaid dividends on such shares. In the event that the assets available for distribution are not sufficient to pay the full preferential amounts, the assets will be distributed pro rata among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. The aggregate preferential amount for Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock was $413.6 million and $959.5 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2019, respectively. After payment of the full liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of common stock, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the remaining assets of the Company legally available for distribution, if any, in an amount equal to the applicable original issue price per share, for each share of Preferred Stock held by them, plus all declared and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. In the event that the assets available for distribution are not sufficient to pay the full such preferential amount, the available assets shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount that each such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive. The aggregate preferential amount for the Series A Preferred Stock was $2.7 million and $2.4 million as of June 30, 2018 and 2019. After payment of the liquidation preferences to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred Stock, and Series F Preferred Stock, the entire remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution, if any, shall be distributed ratably to the holders of common stock. Voting The holder of each share of preferred stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock into which such preferred stock is convertible at the time of the vote. With respect to such vote, such holder has full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights of the holders of common stock. For so long as any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding, the vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding preferred stock shall be required for effecting or validating certain actions, including: (1) consummation of a liquidation event or any other merger or consolidation; (2) any amendment, alteration, or repeal of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the Company; (3) any increase or decrease in the authorized number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or any series thereof; (4) any authorization or designation, whether by reclassification or otherwise, of a new class or series of stock that is not junior to the existing series of preferred stock with respect to dividends, F-28 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC.

The Company classifies preferred stock in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , which requires that contingently redeemable securities be classified outside of permanent stockholders\u2019 equity. Accordingly, the Company has classified all shares and classes of preferred stock as mezzanine equity in the accompanying financial statements as of June 30, 2018 and 2019.

Equity-Based Compensation 2015 Stock Plan In April 2015, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of the 2015 Stock Plan (\u201c2015 Plan\u201d) to provide stock award grants to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. The Board of Directors, or at its sole discretion, a committee of the Board of Directors, is responsible for the administration of the 2015 Plan. As of June 30, 2019, the Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to 85,725,084 shares of common stock for stock award grants, including incentive and non-statutory stock options. The 2015 Plan requires that the per share exercise price of each stock option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to the stock option on the grant date. Stock option grants shall not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of its grant or such shorter period as specified in a stock award agreement. For F-29 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS initial grants, vesting generally occurs over four years with the first 25% of the award vesting upon the 12-month anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% vesting monthly over the following 36 months. The 2015 Plan provides that the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on transferability of stock options as the Board of Directors shall determine. In the absence of a determination by the Board of Directors to the contrary, stock options shall not be transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and domestic relations orders, unless specifically agreed to by the plan administrator. The 2015 Plan allows for the early exercise of stock options. Shares purchased pursuant to the early exercise of stock options are subject to repurchase until those shares vest; therefore, cash received in exchange for unvested shares exercised is recorded as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and are reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the shares vest. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the Company granted options to purchase 4,274,000 shares under the 2015 Plan, consisting of 1,805,552 shares subject to incentive stock options and 2,468,448 shares subject to non-statutory stock options. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company granted options to purchase 23,847,756 shares under the 2015 Plan, consisting of 5,268,903 shares subject to incentive stock options and 18,578,853 shares subject to non-statutory stock options. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company granted options to purchase 32,108,062 shares under the 2015 Plan, consisting of 5,594,291 shares subject to incentive stock options and 26,513,771 subject to non-statutory stock options. The following summary sets forth the stock option activity under the 2015 Plan: [TABLE_502] Options Outstanding Number of Stock Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in millions) Outstanding \u2014 June 30, 2016 21,466,272 $ 0.65 9.4 $ 48.1 Granted 4,274,000 0.76 Exercised (1,893,000 ) 0.38 4.9 Cancelled (1,497,100 ) 0.54 Outstanding \u2014 June 30, 2017 22,350,172 0.70 8.5 48.9 Granted 23,847,756 3.08 Exercised (5,746,588 ) 1.29 11.5 Cancelled (1,949,076 ) 0.96 Outstanding \u2014 June 30, 2018 38,502,264 2.07 8.6 46.5 Granted 32,108,062 11.59 Exercised (4,205,766 ) 2.27 40.2 Cancelled (1,802,436 ) 4.88 Outstanding \u2014 June 30, 2019 64,602,124 6.71 8.6 972.0 Vested and Exercisable \u2014 June 30, 2019 17,070,931 2.41 7.5 330.2 The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding, vested and exercisable were calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the options and the estimated fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock, as of June 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019. As part of the 2015 Plan, the Company issued options to certain key management that vest upon the achievement of certain performance milestones. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense related to the performance based options of $0.8 million. F-30 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the weighted-average grant date fair value per option was $0.53, $1.67, and $6.71, respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes method with the following assumptions: [TABLE_503] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 Weighted-average risk-free interest rate (1) 1.4 % 2.4 % 2.5 % Weighted-average expected term (in years) 6.3 6.3 6.3 Weighted-average expected volatility (2) 79.3 % 55.2 % 45.0 % Expected dividend yield \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 [TABLE_504] (1) Based on U.S. Treasury seven-year constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected term of the option. [TABLE_505] (2) Expected volatility is based on an analysis of comparable public company volatilities and adjusted for the Company\u2019s stage of development. With respect to the 2015 Plan, the Company recognized stock compensation expense of $1.9 million, $8.5 million, and $28.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had $217.2 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.9 years. 14. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers and Vendors Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the compositions and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019, there were no customers representing greater than 10% of the Company\u2019s total revenue. The Company\u2019s top three vendors accounted for approximately 94% and 91% of total finished goods purchases for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Company\u2019s top four vendors accounted for approximately 91% of total finished goods purchases for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. 15. Income Taxes The Company\u2019s provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, 2018, and 2019 was zero, $0.1 million, and $0.1 million, respectively. The tax income provision consists of the Texas state franchise tax and international income taxes. A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows: [TABLE_506] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 Federal income tax rate 35.0 % 28.1 % 21.0 % Permanent differences (0.2 ) (1.0 ) (4.2 ) Return to provision \u2014 \u2014 (0.4 ) Effect of rates different than statutory \u2014 \u2014 (0.3 ) State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 4.3 4.5 3.0 Franchise tax \u2014 (0.1 ) \u2014 Change in valuation allowance (40.1 ) 3.7 (21.0 ) Rate change \u2014 (39.3 ) (0.4 ) Federal credits 1.0 4.0 2.3 Effective income tax rate \u2014 % (0.1 )% \u2014 % F-31 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 are due to the change in valuation allowance and permanent differences related to stock compensation. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 are due to the rate change on deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cAct\u201d), partially offset by state and local taxes and federal tax credits. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company\u2019s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 are due to the change in valuation allowance, partially offset by state and local taxes. On December 22, 2017, the Act was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d). Changes include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and numerous domestic and international-related provisions effective in 2018. The Company has estimated its provision for income taxes specifically related to the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate in accordance with the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result has recorded $18.0 million of income tax expense, which was offset by a corresponding adjustment for the same amount to the Company\u2019s valuation allowance, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) was issued to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company recorded $18.0 million of the income tax expense in connection with the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of June 30, 2019, the Company has completed the accounting for all the impacts of the Act with no material changes to the provisional estimate recorded in the prior period. As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), deferred revenue, research and development tax credits, non-qualified stock options, and accrued litigation reserves. A valuation allowance was maintained on substantially all worldwide gross deferred tax asset balances as of June 30, 2018 and 2019. As of each reporting date, the Company\u2019s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management\u2019s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. The recognition of deferred tax assets was based on the evaluation of current and estimated future profitability of the operations, reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood of utilizing tax credit and/or loss carryforwards. As of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019, the Company continued to maintain that it is not more likely than not that its deferred taxes will be realized in the United States and United Kingdom due to management\u2019s expectation of continued tax losses for the foreseeable future. F-32 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows: [TABLE_507] June 30, 2018 2019 (in millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss $ 28.9 $ 34.4 Accruals and reserves 4.2 10.0 R&D credit 2.8 7.7 Accrued legal and professional fees 4.0 4.8 Non-qualified stock options 1.4 8.8 Deferred rent 1.3 2.9 Property and equipment 0.9 0.2 Intangible Amortization \u2014 0.9 Inventory capitalization 0.8 5.0 Deferred revenue 1.0 10.4 Tenant improvement allowance \u2014 2.9 Other 0.5 0.6 Total deferred tax assets 45.9 88.5 Valuation allowance (45.9 ) (86.9 ) Deferred tax liabilities: Prepaid expenses \u2014 (1.4 ) Total deferred tax liabilities \u2014 (1.4 ) Deferred tax assets, net $ \u2014 $ 0.3 As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company had federal NOLs of approximately $110.0 million and $112.6 million, respectively, of which $59.3 million will begin to expire in 2036 and the remainder will be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has undergone two ownership changes on November 30, 2015 and April 18, 2017 and its NOLs are subject to a Section 382 limitation. The total NOLs subject to a 382 limitation are $72,338 as of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019. The resulting Section 382 limitations are large enough to avail the Section 382 limited NOLs by June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company had state NOLs of approximately $94.0 million and $95.8 million, respectively, which will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2021 if not utilized. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company had foreign NOLs of zero and approximately $26.7 million, respectively, generated from its operations in the United Kingdom, which will be carried forward indefinitely. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company had $2.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of U.S. research and development credit carryovers that will begin to expire in 2036. As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not have material undistributed foreign earnings. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax on the undistributed earnings from the Company\u2019s international subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. As of June 30, 2018 and 2019, the Company has not recognized any uncertain tax positions. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The tax years ended June 30, 2018, February 25, 2018, February 26, 2017 and February 29, 2016 remain subject to examination by tax authorities. F-33 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC.

Segment information is presented in the same manner that the Company\u2019s Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit for each of the reportable segments. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue incurred by the segment. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company does not allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on an entity wide group basis. As of June 30, 2019, the Company did not have material assets located outside of the United States. The Connected Fitness Product segment derives revenue from sale of the Bike, Tread, and related accessories, and associated fees for delivery and installation and extended warranty agreements. The Subscription segment derives revenue from monthly Subscription fees as well as credits from live studio classes. The Other segment primarily consists of boutique and apparel sales. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company\u2019s segments. Key financial performance measures of the segments including revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit are as follows: [TABLE_511] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (in millions) Connected Fitness Products: Revenue $ 183.5 $ 348.6 $ 719.2 Cost of revenue 113.5 195.0 410.8 Gross profit $ 70.0 $ 153.6 $ 308.4 Subscription: Revenue $ 32.5 $ 80.3 $ 181.1 Cost of revenue 29.3 45.5 103.7 Gross profit $ 3.2 $ 34.7 $ 77.4 Other: Revenue $ 2.6 $ 6.2 $ 14.7 Cost of revenue 1.9 4.9 17.0 Gross profit $ 0.8 $ 1.3 $ (2.3 ) Consolidated: Revenue $ 218.6 $ 435.0 $ 915.0 Cost of revenue 144.7 245.4 531.4 Gross profit $ 73.9 $ 189.6 $ 383.6 Reconciliation of Gross Profit Operating expenditures, interest (income) and other expense, and taxes are not allocated to individual segments as these are managed on an entity wide group basis. The reconciliation between reportable segment gross profit to consolidated loss before tax is as follows: [TABLE_512] Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017 2018 2019 (in millions) Segment Gross Profit $ 73.9 $ 189.6 $ 383.6 Research and development (13.0 ) (23.4 ) (54.8 ) Sales and marketing (86.0 ) (151.4 ) (324.0 ) General and administrative (45.6 ) (62.4 ) (207.0 ) Total other income (expense), net (0.3 ) (0.3 ) 6.7 Loss before provision for income taxes $ (71.1 ) $ (47.8 ) $ (195.6 ) F-35 Table of Contents PELOTON INTERACTIVE, INC.

ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, authorizes a court to award, or a corporation\u2019s board of directors to grant, indemnity to directors and officers under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. The terms of Section 145 of the DGCL are sufficiently broad to permit indemnification under certain circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement of expenses incurred, arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. As permitted by the DGCL, the Registrant\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect following the completion of this offering contains provisions that eliminate the personal liability of its directors for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as a director, except liability for the following: [TABLE_515] \u2022 any breach of the director\u2019s duty of loyalty to the Registrant or its stockholders; [TABLE_516] \u2022 acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; [TABLE_517] \u2022 under Section 174 of the DGCL (regarding unlawful dividends and stock purchases); or [TABLE_518] \u2022 any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. As permitted by the DGCL, the Registrant\u2019s restated bylaws that will be in effect following the completion of this offering provide that: [TABLE_519] \u2022 the Registrant is required to indemnify its directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to very limited exceptions; [TABLE_520] \u2022 the Registrant may indemnify its other employees and agents as set forth in the DGCL; [TABLE_521] \u2022 the Registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its directors and executive officers in connection with a legal proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, subject to very limited exceptions; and [TABLE_522] \u2022 the rights conferred in the restated bylaws are not exclusive. II-1 Table of Contents Prior to this offering, the Registrant has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its current directors and executive officers to provide these directors and executive officers additional contractual assurances regarding the scope of the indemnification set forth in the Registrant\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and to provide additional procedural protections. At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving a director, executive officer, or employee of the Registrant regarding which indemnification is sought. Reference is also made to the underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement, which provides for the indemnification of executive officers, directors, and controlling persons of the Registrant against certain liabilities. The indemnification provisions in the Registrant\u2019s restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and the indemnification agreements entered into or to be entered into between the Registrant and each of its directors and executive officers may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of the Registrant\u2019s directors and executive officers for liabilities arising under the Securities Act. The Registrant has directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance for its directors and officers. Certain of the Registrant\u2019s directors are also indemnified by their employers with regard to their service on the Registrant\u2019s board of directors. In addition, the underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement provides for indemnification by the underwriters of the Registrant and its officers and directors for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act, or otherwise.

II-3 Table of Contents ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to provisions described in Item 14 above, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. II-4 Table of Contents SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act, the Registrant has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of New York, State of New York, on August 27, 2019.
